Two late tries flattered the visitors, who have one game left before launching their World Cup campaign against Fiji on 18 September. \"We gave away penalties and our discipline was shocking,\" said Robshaw. \"Whether it was rust, or nerves, it wasn't good enough. Credit to France, they put us under pressure and made us make mistakes. \"We gave too many penalties away, but in the second half we came out and played well but couldn't quite get over the line in the end,\" he told Sky Sports. \"We can't give teams like France and other quality sides head starts like we did. \"We'll look long and hard at ourselves, because we let ourselves down in the first half. We played well in phases but you can't wait for 40 minutes to do that.\" Late tries from Danny Cipriani and Jonathan Joseph made it close on the scoreboard but Lancaster was left with much to ponder by a disappointing team display in the Stade de France. Media playback is not supported on this device The head coach, who must announce his final squad by 31 August, added: \"We've got to get our discipline at the breakdown - we can't give France easy position like we did. We need to improve on that, because all the little mistakes add up. \"The bench made a difference. It upped the energy levels and we scored some good tries. I won't gloss over what went on before that, because it was too little too late. \"There are a few players who have given me food for thought, those guys who came on and gave us the energy we needed and made a difference. \"I need to have a sleep on this game and think about my final squad. We're two weeks away from playing Ireland and four weeks away from Fiji in the World Cup and we'll expect a reaction next time.\" England host Ireland in their final World Cup warm-up game at Twickenham on 5 September. Fly-half Ford told Sky Sports: \"I thought we might snatch that at the end but we had hardly any ball in the first half and gave away too many penalties. We played some good stuff in the second-half. \"In the first half a lot of our undoing was down to ourselves. We just weren't good enough in that first half and there's no excuse for that. We let them build up the score and that made it hard for us. \"It was frustrating and we had to think of ways to adapt and that was constantly going through our minds. We tried to get ourselves out of a hole. \"We've got to turn up against Ireland now and make sure that we win.

Denmark's Soren Kjeldsen (68) and American Keegan Bradley (68) are three shots off the lead, two clear of defending champion Zach Johnson (70). Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy shot 71 in the worst of the weather to finish eight shots off the pace.

Meanwhile, Germany's two-time major winner Martin Kaymer got to seven under but triple bogeyed the 10th and finished with a 73 for three under. The wind blew harder and the rain fell heavier after Mickelson reached the safety of the clubhouse, destroying the chances of a host of big names. World number three Jordan Spieth shot a 75 to finish right on four-over-par and just make the cut, as did England's Masters champion Danny Willett, Northern Ireland's Graeme McDowell, and Scottish duo Colin Montgomerie and Paul Lawrie. England's former US Open champion Justin Rose shot a 77 to finish three over, while world number one Jason Day battled to a 70 to finish one over. US Open champion and world number two Dustin Johnson had two double bogeys but still managed a 69 for two under overall. World number five Bubba Watson holed a birdie at the last to extend his stay. The two-time Masters champion double-bogeyed 11 and struggled to a 76 and four-over total.

The five-time major winner told BBC Sport: \"If I look back to my mid-30s, I am 35lbs lighter, in better shape than I was and can manage the symptoms of my psoriatic arthritis. I feel stronger and in a better condition than I have ever been. \"I can't see why I can't play my best golf in the coming years. I am optimistic about this week and the coming years and the opportunities to add to my resume.\" Mickelson teed off in overcast but benign conditions and covered the front nine in 33 shots, very nearly acing the eighth hole. It started to rain when he hit the turn and he dropped his first shot of the tournament at the par-four 12th, but ground things out as others wilted. Mickelson's feats were brought into sharper focus by the efforts of playing partners Lee Westwood and Ernie Els, who started their rounds on level par. England's Westwood carded a 73, while two-time Open champion Els shot a five-over 76 and missed the cut by one shot.

After all, Ringrose wears the number 13, played for Blackrock, UCD, Leinster and didn't start his rugby career as a centre. But the 22-year-old new kid on the block appears destined to make a name for himself and his entry into the Six Nations fray is keenly anticipated. Ireland coach Joe Schmidt was careful not to throw Ringrose into the international arena too early. But the emerging player is regarded as a young man with a mature head in his shoulders, someone well equipped to handle hype and huge media attention. But, what makes him so special? What are the qualities that had O'Driscoll himself calling for the Leinster lad to be included in Ireland's last Six Nations campaign? \"He has been anointed the next Brian O'Driscoll. Brian was similar at that age, efficient and solid,\" says Eddie O'Sullivan, Ireland's coach from 2001 to 2008. \"Garry's trademark is he is incredibly efficient. Young players make bloopers, but he doesn't make mistakes. It's important to remain calm under pressure and then when your opportunity comes, you take it. \"Brian didn't make mistakes and then he stepped up. No-one expected him to score a try in Paris in 2000, but he scored three. \"Then no-one expected him to score that try against Australia for the Lions a year later, but he did. These are the moments. They came to him and he took them. Then he kicked on, kept improving.\" Ringrose made his senior Ireland debut in the autumn international against Canada last November, a week after being an unused replacement in that historic win over the All Blacks in Chicago. He then scored his first international try in the exciting 27-24 win over Australia in Dublin. Ringrose played his school rugby for Blackrock College in Dublin, although when he joined the senior side, he wasn't seen as one of their better players. Hopping from number nine to 15 and not being offered a permanent position, he kept his head down and eventually an injury opened up a spot at 13. After the switch, he remained their kicker and his points tally propelled Blackrock to the Leinster Senior Cup. Suddenly people were asking who this guy was and he was off to UCD with a glowing reputation. Bobby Byrne, the Director of Rugby at UCD, recalls: \"I first came across Gary in that run to the Senior Cup. He wasn't overly recognised at that stage but suddenly he was having a significant impact for the team. He is the player I am most looking forward to seeing in this year's Six Nations. \"He had composure, was an elusive runner and was really courageous. He hadn't the biggest frame, but he had a good bit of pace to finish off. \"He had, and still has, a great temperament. He is a very balanced guy. The rate of improvement since he has left school has been phenomenal. \"He has improved every year and he's conscious that he always needs to improve, so his\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nGarry Ringrose is the latest Irish rugby sensation being compared to Brian O'Driscoll, with the 21-year-old set to make his Six Nations debut against Wales this weekend.</s", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "G", "ar", "ry", "▁Ring", "rose", "▁is", "▁the", "▁latest", "▁Irish", "▁rugby", "▁sens", "ation", "▁being", "▁compared", "▁to", "▁Brian", "▁O", "'", "D", "ris", "coll", ",", "▁with", "▁the", "▁", "2", "1", "-", "year", "-", "old", "▁set", "▁to", "▁make", "▁his", "▁Six", "▁Nations", "▁debut", "▁against", "▁Wales", "▁this", "▁week", "end", ".", "</s>"], "token_logprobs": [-7.152555099310121e-07, -0.04369509965181351, -0.5063595175743103, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -0.00549034308642149, -0.004323065280914307, -0.01582750305533409, -0.3130786120891571, -0.292916476726532, -0.31392350792884827, -0.010404275730252266, -0.05793546140193939, 0.0, -0.0005380851216614246, -4.768360213347478e-06, 0.0, -3.576278118089249e-07, 0.0, 0.0, -1.9788545614574105e-05, 0.0, -3.576278118089249e-07, -0.025407705456018448, -0.15917269885540009, -0.5763077139854431, -0.002432247158139944, 0.0, -0.00024720950750634074, 0.0, 0.0, -1.1920928244535389e-07, 0.0, -0.12288212776184082, 0.0, -1.1920928244535389e-07, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.3876389265060425, -0.0001902399235405028, -0.8270289301872253, 0.0, 0.0, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -0.3608914613723755], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": -7.152555099310121e-07, "G": -0.04369509965181351, "ar": -0.5063595175743103, "ry": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "▁Ring": -0.00549034308642149, "rose": -0.004323065280914307, "▁is": -0.01582750305533409, "▁the": -0.5763077139854431, "▁latest": -0.292916476726532, "▁Irish": -0.31392350792884827, "▁rugby": -0.010404275730252266, "▁sens": -0.05793546140193939, "ation": 0.0, "▁being": -0.0005380851216614246, "▁compared": -4.768360213347478e-06, "▁to": 0.0, "▁Brian": -3.576278118089249e-07, "▁O": 0.0, "'": 0.0, "D": -1.9788545614574105e-05, "ris": 0.0, "coll": -3.576278118089249e-07, ",": -0.025407705456018448, "▁with": -0.15917269885540009, "▁": -0.002432247158139944, "2": 0.0, "1": -0.00024720950750634074, "-": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "year": 0.0, "old": 0.0, "▁set": -0.12288212776184082, "▁make": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "▁his": 0.0, "▁Six": 0.0, "▁Nations": 0.0, "▁debut": 0.0, "▁against": -0.3876389265060425, "▁Wales": -0.0001902399235405028, "▁this": -0.8270289301872253, "▁week": 0.0, "end": 0.0, ".": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "</s>": -0.3608914613723755}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

He is favoured by many conservatives who consider him to espouse a similarly strict interpretation of law as Scalia. Judge Gorsuch was first nominated to the 10th US Circuit Court of Appeals by former President George W Bush in 2006. Judge Gorsuch began his law career clerking for Supreme Court Justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy, the latter of whom he could now serve alongside. He worked in a private law practice in Washington for a decade and served as the principal deputy assistant associate attorney general at the Justice Department under the Bush administration. Judge Gorsuch graduated from Columbia University and Harvard Law School, where former President Barack Obama was a classmate, and earned a doctorate in legal philosophy at Oxford University. Perhaps it was during his time in England that he accumulated what his former law partner, Mark Hansen, has said was \"an inexhaustible store\" of Winston Churchill quotes. Judge Gorsuch - who reportedly likes to fly-fish and hunt - lives in Boulder with his wife Louise and two daughters, where he is also an adjunct law professor at the University of Colorado. If confirmed by the Senate, he would become the only Protestant on the current bench. The other justices are Jewish and Catholic. His family is well-connected in Republican establishment politics. His mother, Anne Gorsuch Burford, was the first female director of the Environmental Protection Agency during the Reagan administration. He is known for his clear and concise writing style, navigating the most complex legal issues as deftly as the double-black diamond slopes on which he is reputedly an expert skier in the snow-capped mountain state he calls home. Judge Gorsuch's published writings reveal his conservative leanings. He argued against euthanasia in his 2006 book The Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia. \"All human beings are intrinsically valuable and the intentional taking of human life by private persons is always wrong,\" he wrote. In a 2005 article in the National Review, Judge Gorsuch argued that \"American liberals have become addicted to the courtroom\". He said they keep \"relying on judges and lawyers rather than elected leaders and the ballot box, as the primary means of effecting their social agenda\". Judge Gorsuch has never ruled on abortion, and he is not expected to call into question high-profile rulings on that issue or gay marriage. His conservative outlook cements Mr Trump's campaign promise to nominate a judge \"in the mould\" of Justice Scalia, restoring the nine-seat high court's 5-4 conservative majority. Much like the late Scalia, the Ivy-League educated judge is known to support textualism, or the interpretation of law according to its plain text. He also maintains a strict interpretation of the US Constitution, or how it was originally understood by the Founding Fathers. While sitting on the bench of the 10th Circuit, Judge Gorsuch sided with groups that successfully challenged the Obama administration's requirements for employers to provide health insurance that includes contraception in the Hobby Lobby Stores\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nPresident Trump has nominated Neil Gorsuch, a conservative federal appeals court judge with a reputation for strict interpretation of the law, to fill the Supreme Court seat left vacant by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia.</s", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "Pres", "ident", "▁Trump", "▁has", "▁nominated", "▁Neil", "▁G", "ors", "uch", ",", "▁a", "▁conserv", "ative", "▁federal", "▁appe", "als", "▁court", "▁judge", "▁with", "▁a", "▁reputation", "▁for", "▁strict", "▁interpretation", "▁of", "▁the", "▁law", ",", "▁to", "▁fill", "▁the", "▁Supreme", "▁Court", "▁seat", "▁left", "▁vac", "ant", "▁by", "▁the", "▁death", "▁of", "▁Justice", "▁Anton", "in", "▁S", "cal", "ia", ".", "</s>"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.005229366011917591, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -0.36093243956565857, -0.123328298330307, -7.414542778860778e-05, -0.5962483882904053, -0.00015877417172305286, -2.992108420585282e-05, 0.0, -0.053127072751522064, -2.038458114839159e-05, -0.0005886013968847692, -3.576278118089249e-07, -0.09801335632801056, -0.3611402213573456, 0.0, -0.02324940636754036, 0.0, -0.43161579966545105, -2.4676019165781327e-05, -0.002463284647092223, -7.152555099310121e-07, -1.8358061424805783e-05, -0.5240493416786194, 0.0, -0.00036459474358707666, -0.0020329540129750967, -0.0001597276859683916, 0.0, -0.03714646399021149, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -0.008294538594782352, 0.0, -2.50339189733495e-06, -0.00015841660206206143, -0.01028511393815279, 0.0, 0.0, -0.03827951103448868, -0.00010442188795423135, 0.0, -0.17301005125045776, -1.6689286894688848e-06, -1.0728830375228426e-06, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.00010466027742950246, -0.17302118241786957], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "Pres": -0.005229366011917591, "ident": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "▁Trump": -0.36093243956565857, "▁has": -0.123328298330307, "▁nominated": -7.414542778860778e-05, "▁Neil": -0.5962483882904053, "▁G": -0.00015877417172305286, "ors": -2.992108420585282e-05, "uch": 0.0, ",": -0.0001597276859683916, "▁a": -2.4676019165781327e-05, "▁conserv": -0.0005886013968847692, "ative": -3.576278118089249e-07, "▁federal": -0.09801335632801056, "▁appe": -0.3611402213573456, "als": 0.0, "▁court": -0.02324940636754036, "▁judge": 0.0, "▁with": -0.43161579966545105, "▁reputation": -0.002463284647092223, "▁for": -7.152555099310121e-07, "▁strict": -1.8358061424805783e-05, "▁interpretation": -0.5240493416786194, "▁of": 0.0, "▁the": -0.03827951103448868, "▁law": -0.0020329540129750967, "▁to": 0.0, "▁fill": -0.03714646399021149, "▁Supreme": -0.008294538594782352, "▁Court": 0.0, "▁seat": -2.50339189733495e-06, "▁left": -0.00015841660206206143, "▁vac": -0.01028511393815279, "ant": 0.0, "▁by": 0.0, "▁death": -0.00010442188795423135, "▁Justice": -0.17301005125045776, "▁Anton": -1.6689286894688848e-06, "in": -1.0728830375228426e-06, "▁S": 0.0, "cal": 0.0, "ia": 0.0, ".": -0.00010466027742950246, "</s>": -0.17302118241786957}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

By the end of the 80s, the graffiti culture was being forced to adapt, as by then, New York's Transit Authority had brought in procedures that made it tougher to gain access to the train yards. New models with coatings that were resistant to paint, and faster cleaning of any that were covered in graffiti also meant the artists' work was short-lived and the thrill of seeing the work trundling around the city was lost. In the years since, some of the artists have fared well in the US and Europe, others have spent time in prison, one has become a policeman and some have died. The art itself is now part of the mainstream, no longer reserved for city walls but a regular part of a designer's armoury. For Cooper, the graffiti work is an important part of her time in New York, producing the images she is most proud of, rather than those shot on assignment for newspapers or magazines. At times, she would spend hours waiting and watching, for that moment when good light combined with a powerful piece of art passing through an interesting part of the city. Chalfant approached the graffiti from a different angle, concentrating on the work itself, often shooting a series of overlapping images using the motor drive on his camera. He would then splice the pictures together in his studio. He said at the time: \"I was more interested in capturing the beautiful, ephemeral work of art than in taking a beautiful picture as a photographer.\" Here is a selection of the photographs by Cooper and Chalfant.

In February, a consignment of beef being stored at Freeza Meats was found to contain horsemeat. It did not belong to Freeza Meats and none of their products tested positive for horsemeat. Mr Fairburn, who is now retired, said the beef belonged to another company, McAdam Foods, and that his firm has suffered. He told MPs the scandal had led to his firm missing out on multi-million pound orders and had resulted in 31 jobs being lost in Newry. Quizzed by MPs on the Environment and Rural Affairs Committee about the horsemeat scandal, Mr Fairburn described it as a \"fraud\" and said it was \"being perpetrated by a big organisation\". He also said he suspected it had been \"going on for some time\". He told MPs that the illegal meat trade originated in other parts of Europe and did not come from the UK or Ireland. He rejected a suggestion from the Conservative MP Anne McIntosh that \"all roads lead to Ireland\". Asked if the scandal originated in Ireland, Mr Fairburn said \"not at all\". Mr Fairburn faced questioning from Conservative and Labour MPs and the South Down SDLP MP Margaret Ritchie. MPs also heard evidence from the Food Standards Agency. Tests carried out on the meat stored at Freeza Meats found that samples from the consignment contained about 80% horsemeat. It followed the discovery of horse DNA at a plant in the Republic of Ireland. Newry and Mourne Council confirmed that tests on Freeza Meats' burgers were free from horsemeat DNA. Martin McAdam, whose firm owned the contaminated meat, said there was \"clearly an issue\" with their Polish supplier.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nA Westminster Environment Orgisation heard evidence about the horsemeat scandal, with one witness accusing a big organisation of perpetrating a fraud.\n\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "A", "▁West", "min", "ster", "▁Environment", "▁Or", "g", "isation", "▁heard", "▁evidence", "▁about", "▁the", "▁hors", "eme", "at", "▁sc", "andal", ",", "▁with", "▁one", "▁witness", "▁acc", "using", "▁a", "▁big", "▁organisation", "▁of", "▁perpet", "rating", "▁a", "▁fra", "ud", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁The", "▁", "2", "8", "-", "year", "-", "old", ",", "▁of", "▁no", "▁fixed", "▁address", ",", "▁was", "▁sent", "enced", "▁to", "▁", "1", "8"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.12354440242052078, -0.3030049502849579, -0.00116637849714607, 0.0, -0.06524977833032608, -0.8362557888031006, -0.00014137222024146467, -0.00019560330838430673, -0.2363143265247345, -1.0609570381348021e-05, -0.5385985970497131, -0.002224234864115715, -2.3841855067985307e-07, -1.6689286894688848e-06, 0.0, -7.152555099310121e-07, -1.8715683836489916e-05, -0.027603568509221077, -0.02779732458293438, -0.30596688389778137, -0.006789826788008213, -0.009038958698511124, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -0.0066144573502242565, -0.000927137560211122, -8.106198947643861e-06, 0.0, -0.3174646198749542, -0.03505435585975647, -0.2519829571247101, -1.1920928244535389e-07, 0.0, 0.0, -0.0788920596241951, -1.311301275563892e-06, -2.0265558760002023e-06, -0.0007621721015311778, 0.0, -5.602820692729438e-06, -0.000364713923772797, 0.0, 0.0, -0.01279678475111723, -0.03290076553821564, -0.42386022210121155, -1.074946403503418, -7.629365427419543e-06, 0.0, -2.50339189733495e-06, 0.0, -0.3581065535545349, -0.4711998701095581, -0.00037901371251791716, 0.0, -0.0019288521725684404, -3.6954811548639555e-06, -0.07500933110713959, -0.012561723589897156, -0.005540254060178995, -0.05270036309957504, -0.2544277608394623, -0.08531642705202103, -0.059440914541482925], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": -5.602820692729438e-06, "A": -0.12354440242052078, "▁West": -0.3030049502849579, "min": -0.00116637849714607, "ster": 0.0, "▁Environment": -0.06524977833032608, "▁Or": -0.8362557888031006, "g": -0.00014137222024146467, "isation": -0.00019560330838430673, "▁heard": -0.2363143265247345, "▁evidence": -1.0609570381348021e-05, "▁about": -0.5385985970497131, "▁the": -0.002224234864115715, "▁hors": -2.3841855067985307e-07, "eme": -1.6689286894688848e-06, "at": 0.0, "▁sc": -7.152555099310121e-07, "andal": -1.8715683836489916e-05, ",": -3.6954811548639555e-06, "▁with": -0.02779732458293438, "▁one": -0.30596688389778137, "▁witness": -0.006789826788008213, "▁acc": -0.009038958698511124, "using": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "▁a": -0.2519829571247101, "▁big": -0.000927137560211122, "▁organisation": -8.106198947643861e-06, "▁of": -0.4711998701095581, "▁perpet": -0.3174646198749542, "rating": -0.03505435585975647, "▁fra": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "ud": 0.0, ".": 0.0, "##": -0.0007621721015311778, "#": 0.0, "Art": -0.000364713923772797, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "▁The": -0.01279678475111723, "▁": -0.2544277608394623, "2": -0.42386022210121155, "8": -0.059440914541482925, "-": -2.50339189733495e-06, "year": 0.0, "old": 0.0, "▁no": -0.00037901371251791716, "▁fixed": 0.0, "▁address": -0.0019288521725684404, "▁was": -0.07500933110713959, "▁sent": -0.012561723589897156, "enced": -0.005540254060178995, "▁to": -0.05270036309957504, "1": -0.08531642705202103}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

Internet companies will also be required to allow Russian authorities access to users' information. One human rights group called the move \"draconian\". The law was approved by Russia's upper house of parliament in April. It includes measures to ensure that bloggers cannot remain anonymous, and states that social networks must maintain six months of data on its users. The information must be stored on servers based in Russian territory, so that government authorities can gain access. Critics see it as the latest in a series of recent moves to curb internet freedom. Hugh Williamson, of New York-based Human Rights Watch, has called the law \"another milestone in Russia's relentless crackdown on free expression\". \"The internet is the last island of free expression in Russia and these draconian regulations are clearly aimed at putting it under government control,\" he added. Opposition figures have used the internet to air their views, with some gaining millions of followers. Commentators opposing Vladimir Putin often face restrictions in broadcast outlets and newspapers. Analysis: Famil Ismailov, news editor, BBCRussian.com Russian bloggers are bracing themselves for the moment when Russia's new \"information security law\" comes into force on 1 August. Some already share advice on how to use proxy servers in order to access social media sites that, in their view, are under threat of being closed. It is hard to see how the law will be enforced. The servers for most of the popular social media platforms that many Russians use are based outside Russia. Many popular bloggers are already looking for, and apparently finding, ways to \"cheat\" the feature that counts page visits and keep their daily unique visitor numbers just under 3000, or to make sure that the statistics are hidden altogether. Anton Nossik, who is considered Russia's \"internet guru\", wrote in his LiveJournal blog that the new law didn't threaten individual bloggers directly, but provided legal grounds to block popular social networks like Facebook, Twitter, LiveJournal and Google. \"The issue of banning all these platforms in Russia is a political one and it will be decided by only one person\", Mr Nossik wrote, with a thinly veiled reference to President Vladimir Putin. Earlier in the year, Russia enacted a law that gave the government powers to block websites without explanation. In March, Moscow blocked the blog of Mr Navalny, along with two news sites and a organisation run by Garry Kasparov - a vocal critic of the Russian government. In a statement, Russia's prosecutor general's office said the blocks were imposed because of the sites' role in helping stage illegal protests. Earlier this week, Twitter blocked access to an anti-Kremlin account that often publishes leaked government documents, following a request by Russia's federal communications agency Roskomnadzor.

It is the latest in a string of recalls by the carmaker. Toyota has already recalled some 10 million cars globally that were fitted with faulty air bags linked to a number of deaths. The defective window switch affects models including the Yaris model as well as the Corolla, Camry, RAV4, Highlander and others. The recall only affects cars produced between 2005 and 2010. Of the total, about 2.7 million cars were sold in North America, 1.2 million in Europe, and 600,000 in Japan, the company said. The firm explained that modules in a switch related to the electric window might have been lubricated inconsistently during manufacturing. Debris caused by wear from the electrical contact points can accumulate and cause a short-circuit. This could in turn cause the switch to overheat and melt, potentially leading to a fire.

Their combined scores helped them finish ahead of Italy and Germany. Olympic champion Laura Asadauskaite claimed the women's European gold. Asadauskaite, who started the run-shoot a combined 59 seconds behind eventual silver medallist Elodie Clouvel of France, had already secured her place in Rio by winning the World Cup final in June. It meant ninth-placed Alice Sotero of Italy was also rewarded with an Olympic berth in a race which saw Germany's Lena Schoneborn take bronze at the University of Bath. French was delighted by her career-best result which secured Britain their third Olympic place - following Joe Choong's seventh place in the men's event on Saturday and Murray's fifth at the 2015 World Championships. \"It's amazing, I never thought I would be able to do it,\" French told BBC Sport. \"I thought I was pretty average all day to be honest, but held it together in the run-shoot at the end and now I just have to stay strong next year.\" Murray - the silver medallist at London 2012 and 2014 World champion - was expected to challenge for her first European title. She ranked second after the swimming and fourth after the fencing stages, but dropped to ninth after the showjumping round and struggling with her shooting in the final event. \"There was a lot of pressure,\" Murray admitted to BBC Sport. \"I've had a difficult year with some injuries and some personal things going on so hopefully next season will be a fresh start.

The prize was Europe's biggest ever and was capped after a series of rollovers. On the night of the draw Chris was checking their numbers on the BBC's Red Button digital text service about midnight on the television in their bedroom. \"I started circling the numbers I had matched but wasn't doing very well. Then on the fifth line, all the circles seemed to join up.\" The telephone line run by Camelot for claims was closed. Chris and husband Colin sat up all night they were so excited. \"When we first realised we had won, it felt like a dream,\" Colin said. \"Everything went into slow motion.\" Life changing When asked at a media conference in Falkirk what they will do with the money, Chris said: \"We're not flashy people.\" \"The next steps are going to be the most difficult... with great wealth comes great responsibility,\" added Colin. The Weirs have both had serious health conditions in recent years and have not been able to work. Colin, 64, had previously worked as a television cameraman and Chris, 55, is a fully-trained psychiatric nurse. The most exciting aspect of their windfall is the opportunity to travel. \"We have both always wanted to see the Great Wall of China and Colin would love to stand at the foot of Ayers Rock in Australia,\" said Chris. \"We also love art galleries, so this gives us the chance to visit those in Paris and in Russia. These are all things we thought we would never see.\" They have also already decided to buy homes for their two children, Carly and Jamie (both in their 20s). UK winning streak Before Tuesday's draw, the largest lottery winner in the UK was the player who claimed £113m in the Euromillions last October and chose to remain anonymous. The couple have displaced former postal worker Angela Kelly from East Kilbride, who became Scotland's biggest winner in August 2007 when she scooped £35,425,411.80 in the Euromillions jackpot. Britons have banked the Euromillions jackpot more than 14 times in the last two years. Last year, two anonymous UK winners scooped £113m and £84m. And Nigel and Justine Page, from Gloucestershire, won the £56m jackpot prize on EuroMillions in February 2010. National Lottery operator Camelot runs the Euromillions draw in the UK and has also had the same role for the weekly Lotto draw since it was launched in 1994.

Rebecca Hilsenrath, head of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, said the remarks were \"truly disgusting\" as well as unlawful. Mr Wilson said it was \"not a colour issue\" but an \"economic judgement\". Speaking to BBC Asian Network, Mr Wilson, who has amassed nearly 1,000 buy-to-let properties in Kent, said a property he had bought from an Indian couple cost him about Â£12,000 because the curry smell became a \"massive problem\" and he was forced to rip up the carpet and take the house off the market for six months. \"If that makes me racist, that makes 99% of people who buy houses racist,\" he said. \"How many white people are going to go into a house that smells of curry and are going to buy [it]?\" The Equality and Human Rights Commission is investigating and says it will seek legal action where necessary. Ms Hilsenrath said: \"There are still deep inequalities in our society as our race report demonstrated and these comments show why. \"As a country we all assume we have left the dark ages behind, but clearly there is more to be done. \"We will investigate and will be asking Mr Wilson to explain his actions. Unless we are satisfied that he will not break the law in the future we will take legal action\". Kent Police also said it was working to establish if any offences had taken place. In the past, Mr Wilson evicted all 200 of his housing benefit tenants, saying he would rather have \"migrants as tenants than people on benefits\".\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nOOOOOO‍‍OOO‍‍OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "‍", "‍", "O", "O", "O", "‍", "‍", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O"], "token_logprobs": [-1.5616295058862306e-05, -0.16757671535015106, -0.3710697889328003, -0.060138240456581116, -0.018998557701706886, -0.014005943201482296, -0.03593922033905983, -0.030153948813676834, -0.1204017847776413, -0.6239061951637268, -0.7050018310546875, -0.7053483724594116, -0.4708944857120514, -0.32094258069992065, -0.4316991865634918, -0.013179098255932331, -0.02419457770884037, -0.0616445317864418, -0.06379733979701996, -0.04261455312371254, -0.02381773479282856, -0.026273855939507484, -0.03700195625424385, -0.017723986878991127, -0.04342564195394516, -0.008599511347711086, -0.0061413622461259365, -0.012680732645094395, -0.006944803986698389, -0.026211034506559372, -0.0056612868793308735, -0.014278859831392765, -0.007607772946357727, -0.01889714226126671, -0.024487178772687912, -0.004016903694719076, -0.005569417029619217, -0.006821558345109224, -0.002723557874560356, -0.003316855989396572, -0.005450033117085695, -0.0037010284140706062, -0.0030569748487323523, -0.001973587553948164, -0.0011611393420025706, -0.002556985942646861, -0.0009751332108862698, -0.001925639808177948, -0.0015312624163925648, -0.0011703077470883727, -0.001966329989954829, -0.001752984942868352, -0.0010589712765067816, -0.0004744596080854535, -0.0015712546883150935, -0.0012334127677604556, -0.0013221102999523282, -0.0009843033039942384, -0.0005427317810244858, -0.0025439064484089613, -0.0006018257699906826, -0.0006749735912308097, -0.0015685171820223331, -0.0004499138449318707], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": -1.5616295058862306e-05, "O": -0.0004499138449318707, "‍": -0.32094258069992065}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

Many had expected Mr Scioli to lead by a greater margin. The run-off on 22 November will be the first time an Argentine election will be decided by a second round. With 96% of the votes counted, Mr Scioli was marginally ahead with 36.7% of the vote, while Mr Macri had 34.5%. To win outright in the first round, a candidate needed 45% of the vote or a minimum of 40% as well as a 10-point lead over the nearest rival. \"What happened today will change politics in this country,\" Mr Macri, the mayor of Buenos Aires, told supporters. Sergio Massa, a former ally turned rival of outgoing President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, came a distant third with 21.3% of the vote and admitted defeat. Mr Massa has not said who will get his backing in the second round next month. With Mr Macri and Mr Scioli neck-and-neck, Mr Massa's support could prove crucial. Mr Scioli was handpicked as candidate by President Fernandez, who is constitutionally barred from seeking a third term. The governor of Buenos Aires province, he is a former world powerboating champion who lost his right arm in a race in 1989. Late on Sunday, he spoke before thousands of his supporters, saying: \"United together we will triumph. I call upon the undecided and independent voters to join this cause.\" Last week, Mr Scioli pledged tax cuts for workers earning under a certain income, a move expected to affect half a million people. He has also vowed to bring down Argentina's inflation to single digits in less than four years and promises to introduce policy changes to invigorate the economy. Ms Fernandez, who stands down after eight years in power, says she leaves Argentines a better country. \"We are voting today in a completely normal country,\" said Ms Fernandez said after casting her vote in the Patagonian town of Rio Gallegos. In previous decades, Argentines always went to the polls \"in the middle of a serious crisis,\" she added. Ms Fernandez said achieving stability and leaving Argentines \"a normal country\" was the promise made by her late husband, Neston Kirchner, when he took office in 2003. He died in 2010, three years after handing over the presidency to his wife. Argentina elections: All to play for 14.5% Official, but disputed, inflation level 28.2% the inflation level in 2014, according to the World Bank 0.7% amount IMF predicts the economy will shrink in 2016 Whoever wins the presidency faces significant economic challenges. While the country gained strength after a financial crisis in 2002, its economy, the third-largest in Latin America, has slowed in recent years, with GDP growing by only 0.5% last year. The government is also locked in a battle against American hedge funds who disagree with how it wants to restructure $100bn (Â£65bn) of debt on which it defaulted in 2001. While the firms successfully sued Argentina for repayment, Ms Fernandez refused to pay.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\n\nA petition to the Argentinean government was filed on Saturday by the opposition party, the Democratic party of the ruling party of the country, the party of the ruling party of the country, the party of the ruling party of the country, the party of the ruling party of th", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "A", "▁pet", "ition", "▁to", "▁the", "▁Argent", "ine", "an", "▁government", "▁was", "▁file", "d", "▁on", "▁Saturday", "▁by", "▁the", "▁opposition", "▁party", ",", "▁the", "▁Democratic", "▁party", "▁of", "▁the", "▁r", "uling", "▁party", "▁of", "▁the", "▁country", ",", "▁the", "▁party", "▁of", "▁the", "▁r", "uling", "▁party", "▁of", "▁the", "▁country", ",", "▁the", "▁party", "▁of", "▁the", "▁r", "uling", "▁party", "▁of", "▁the", "▁country", ",", "▁the", "▁party", "▁of", "▁the", "▁r", "uling", "▁party", "▁of", "▁the"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.04994577914476395, -0.7463588118553162, -0.024417033419013023, -0.0005347490659914911, -0.10413629561662674, -7.176141662057489e-05, -0.613204300403595, -0.0008974815136753023, -0.004540609661489725, -0.007573937065899372, -0.8932831287384033, -0.15263406932353973, 0.0, -0.31691280007362366, -0.5521494150161743, -0.12280295044183731, -0.06649600714445114, -0.578498363494873, -0.3263348639011383, -0.005268024746328592, -0.003944000229239464, -0.5094460248947144, -0.14334462583065033, -0.010401090607047081, -0.0012735360069200397, -0.00024399164249189198, -2.3841855067985307e-07, -0.2547125220298767, -0.31094586849212646, -4.529942543740617e-06, -0.03112393617630005, -0.17408347129821777, -0.019740547984838486, -0.6126485466957092, -0.00037150635034777224, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -0.0009030792862176895, 0.0, 0.0, -0.15044283866882324, -1.7881377516459906e-06, -8.344646857949556e-07, -0.007586240768432617, -0.012698858976364136, -7.450303382938728e-05, 0.0, 0.0, -0.0008465044084005058, 0.0, 0.0, -4.303362584323622e-05, 0.0, -8.34461570775602e-06, -0.00964209996163845, -0.01909458264708519, -2.539125671319198e-05, 0.0, 0.0, -8.344646857949556e-07, 0.0, 0.0, -9.536738616588991e-07, 0.0], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": -0.04994577914476395, "A": -0.7463588118553162, "▁pet": -0.024417033419013023, "ition": -0.0005347490659914911, "▁to": -0.10413629561662674, "▁the": 0.0, "▁Argent": -0.613204300403595, "ine": -0.0008974815136753023, "an": -0.004540609661489725, "▁government": -0.007573937065899372, "▁was": -0.8932831287384033, "▁file": -0.15263406932353973, "d": 0.0, "▁on": -0.31691280007362366, "▁Saturday": -0.5521494150161743, "▁by": -0.12280295044183731, "▁opposition": -0.578498363494873, "▁party": 0.0, ",": -0.00964209996163845, "▁Democratic": -0.5094460248947144, "▁of": -9.536738616588991e-07, "▁r": -8.344646857949556e-07, "uling": 0.0, "▁country": -8.34461570775602e-06}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

The third in line to the throne and future king turns one on 22 July. The design of the sterling silver piece was approved by his parents; his great-grandmother the Queen; and Chancellor George Osborne. It bears the heraldic royal arms and the year 2014. Prince George was photographed at the weekend walking with the help of his mother. Shane Bissett, director of commemorative coin and bullion at the Royal Mint, said: \"We felt there could be no more fitting design to mark the first birthday of our future king than the royal arms - the arms of the monarch - minted in honour of the future heir to the throne. \"The choice of a silver coin is significant too, as the precious metal is closely associated with newborn babies... \"Crossing the palm of a newborn baby with silver is a way to wish them wealth and good health throughout their life, whilst the £5 coin is a favourite for royal celebrations.\" The coins will be a limited mintage of 7,500 and will cost £80 each from the Royal Mint. The heraldic royal arms incorporates the four quarterings of the royal arms, each contained in a shield, as well as a rose, thistle, leek, a sprig of shamrock and a crown. It was originally created for the Queen and was last used on a coin struck for the British Exhibition in New York in 1960.

Some 2,000 job cuts had been announced or completed in its retail sector over the last three months, the lender said, \"with a reduction of a further 2,000 expected during 2015.\" The bank also said in November that it would close up to 100 bank branches in 2015 in Asia, Africa and the Middle East in an attempt to boost its profitability. On Thursday it said it had made \"good progress in closing 22 branches in the second half of 2014\" and that it was on track to close up to 100. Steven Chan, an analyst at Maybank Kim Eng Securities in Hong Kong said the moves \"would certainly help improve the bank's profits.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nStandard Chartered plans to save $100m in 2016 by cutting 2,000 more jobs and closing 100 branches in Asia, Africa and the Middle East.\n\n\n</s", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "Standard", "▁Char", "tered", "▁plans", "▁to", "▁save", "▁$", "1", "0", "0", "m", "▁in", "▁", "2", "0", "1", "6", "▁by", "▁cutting", "▁", "2", ",", "0", "0", "0", "▁more", "▁jobs", "▁and", "▁closing", "▁", "1", "0", "0", "▁branches", "▁in", "▁Asia", ",", "▁Africa", "▁and", "▁the", "▁Middle", "▁East", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "</s>"], "token_logprobs": [-3.576278118089249e-07, -4.8040190449682996e-05, -1.9073468138230965e-06, 0.0, -0.6744592189788818, 0.0, -0.0012907992349937558, -2.777537883957848e-05, -3.6954811548639555e-06, -0.37956300377845764, -3.2186455882765586e-06, -0.015385161153972149, -0.3750275671482086, -2.002696055569686e-05, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.1730077564716339, -0.027760107070207596, -0.001177690108306706, -0.0015432840446010232, -5.531158240046352e-05, -2.9802276912960224e-06, -2.3841855067985307e-07, 0.0, 0.0, -0.3608907163143158, -6.198863957251888e-06, -0.08662799745798111, -0.0007219092221930623, -0.038523174822330475, -0.006715348921716213, 0.0, 0.0, -0.5067737698554993, -0.562577486038208, -2.861018856492592e-06, -0.004442702513188124, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -0.17300845682621002, 0.0, -2.3841855067985307e-07, -2.3841855067985307e-07, -0.015513459220528603, -0.01895095221698284, -5.602820692729438e-06, -0.00798817165195942, -0.20914749801158905], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": -0.00798817165195942, "Standard": -4.8040190449682996e-05, "▁Char": -1.9073468138230965e-06, "tered": 0.0, "▁plans": -0.6744592189788818, "▁to": 0.0, "▁save": -0.0012907992349937558, "▁$": -2.777537883957848e-05, "1": -0.006715348921716213, "0": 0.0, "m": -0.015385161153972149, "▁in": -0.562577486038208, "▁": -0.038523174822330475, "2": -5.531158240046352e-05, "6": -0.1730077564716339, "▁by": -0.027760107070207596, "▁cutting": -0.001177690108306706, ",": -0.004442702513188124, "▁more": -0.3608907163143158, "▁jobs": -6.198863957251888e-06, "▁and": -0.17300845682621002, "▁closing": -0.0007219092221930623, "▁branches": -0.5067737698554993, "▁Asia": -2.861018856492592e-06, "▁Africa": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "▁the": 0.0, "▁Middle": -2.3841855067985307e-07, "▁East": -2.3841855067985307e-07, ".": -0.015513459220528603, "</s>": -0.20914749801158905}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

The money was widely used to attract investment and jobs to Wales. The archives also show UK Treasury concern at overfunding of Scotland and Northern Ireland under the Barnett formula, a political issue to this day. In the mid-1980s, Wales secured one fifth of inward investment into the UK despite having only 5% of the population. But with the then Conservative government trying to cut public spending, the Treasury tried to cut back regional spending in England. That could have hit the Welsh Office budget and the secretary of state Nicholas Edwards joined his Scottish counterpart George Younger to protest. In a letter to the Treasury chief secretary (and fellow Welshman) Peter Rees - copied to the prime minister - Mr Edwards complained about the implications for his budget. He wrote: \"I agree strongly with the points George Younger has made in his letter. They apply equally in the three territories. The political effects in Wales, as in Scotland, would be most damaging.\" Mr Edwards demanded to be present at meetings between the Treasury and Department for Trade and Industry when the issue was discussed. The archives do not record any reply and Mr Edwards - now Lord Crickhowell - cannot recall the episode. But, in another parallel with today's politics, the archives show Treasury concern at overfunding of Scotland and Northern Ireland under the so-called Barnett formula that is also used to calculate changes in the Welsh budget. Peter Rees, later Lord Rees of Goytre, wrote to Mrs Thatcher: \"Even our predecessors never saw it as any more than a stop-gap arrangement on the road to political devolution, certainly not as the permanency it has now become. \"Be that as it may, the block system is now publicly construed, in the territories, as apolitical entitlement to public expenditure. The longer we let it run the harder it becomes to challenge that perception, and the greater the risk of political repercussion when we do. \" MP David Willetts, then a Downing Street adviser, wrote: \"Scotland and NI have their snouts well and truly in the public expenditure trough. The challenge is to find a politically acceptable way of putting them on the same diet as the English.\" The files reveal that the Treasury considered suspending the formula. Mr Rees wrote to Mrs Thatcher: \"The 'fallback' approach to securing savings is to suspend the operation of the comparability formulae for the Scottish and Northern Ireland blocks - though not for Wales, where over-provision is not suspected.\" Thirty years on, the UK political parties have vowed to keep the formula as part of a deal to keep Scotland in the United Kingdom. Mrs Thatcher's ministers considered launching the controversial poll tax in Wales before England, according to other files just released. The documents released by the National Archives also show Conservative government advisers feared a repeat of the 1984-85 miners' strike the following winter.

The SGA has called for a public inquiry into the impact of the reintroduction of the birds on the east coast. RSPB Scotland has described the small child claim as \"alarmist nonsense\". The Scottish government said it was not aware of any attacks by sea eagles on children in other countries and did not think a public inquiry was necessary. In a letter to the Scottish government, the SGA warned that the attack on the Very Reverend Hunter Farquharson in Abernethy, in Perthshire, could be the first of many. The association has asked for the formulation of an \"exit strategy\" if the sea eagles turn out to have an adverse effect on social, economic or leisure activities. In the letter, the SGA said: \"These creatures are being released into what is a comparatively densely populated area so they will come into contact with humans on a daily basis. \"That will instil habituated behaviour and remove what should be a healthy fear of humans. \"There are reports of buzzards which have obviously undergone this desensitisation and this has resulted in them attacking people. This could pose a serious threat in the future. \"Will these very large creatures differentiate between a small child and more natural quarry?\" The Perth-based SGA represents gamekeepers, stalkers, ghillies, wildlife managers and rangers. Association committee member Bert Burnett said the group did not have a problem with sea eagles on Scotland's west coast. He said: \"As far as we are concerned these sea eagles seem to be doing fine and not posing a threat.\" However, Mr Burnett said more consultation was needed on the release of the birds on the east coast. He added: \"Some might think this is gamekeepers making a fuss for some obscure reason. \"That's not the case. It is a genuine concern and it is a concern felt by other people out there other than gamekeepers.\" On the micro blogging website Twitter, RSPB Scotland tweeted: \"Alarmist nonsense from the SGA. \"Sea eagle could soon be eating small children. Surely ScotGov won't take this seriously.\" A spokesman for RSPB Scotland said the Perthshire incident was unfortunate and regrettable but that the bird had reacted as other wild animals might do when cornered. He said the SGA claim about eagles, the UK's largest bird of prey, targeting small children as ridiculous. With a wing span of 8ft, the white-tailed sea eagle is the UK's largest bird of prey. It was completely wiped out in Britain in the early 20th Century and only returned when a reintroduction programme began on the island of Rum in 1975. Mull, Wester Ross and Skye also now have established populations. In August this year, a new batch of 16 young sea eagles were released in Fife. A Scottish government said the raptors were widespread in many parts of Europe, including densely populated areas. A spokeswoman said: \"We are not aware of any attacks\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nThe Scottish Gamekeepers Association has called for a public inquiry into the impact of reintroduced sea eagles on the east coast of Scotland, after a senior clergyman was injured by an attacking eagle, but the Scottish Government has rejected the association's claim that the birds pose ", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "The", "▁Scottish", "▁Game", "keep", "ers", "▁Association", "▁has", "▁called", "▁for", "▁a", "▁public", "▁inqu", "iry", "▁into", "▁the", "▁impact", "▁of", "▁re", "int", "rodu", "ced", "▁sea", "▁e", "ag", "les", "▁on", "▁the", "▁east", "▁coast", "▁of", "▁Scotland", ",", "▁after", "▁a", "▁senior", "▁cl", "erg", "yman", "▁was", "▁injured", "▁by", "▁an", "▁attack", "ing", "▁e", "agle", ",", "▁but", "▁the", "▁Scottish", "▁Government", "▁has", "▁rejected", "▁the", "▁association", "'", "s", "▁claim", "▁that", "▁the", "▁birds", "▁pose", "▁a"], "token_logprobs": [-2.3841855067985307e-07, -0.0030637490563094616, -1.2993727978027891e-05, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -1.6689160474925302e-05, -0.002954762661829591, -6.794906312279636e-06, 0.0, -0.006715348921716213, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -1.9788545614574105e-05, -1.0728830375228426e-06, -0.3609340190887451, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -0.5179677605628967, -0.00010442188795423135, 0.0, -0.035052284598350525, -0.36088621616363525, 0.0, -4.768370445162873e-07, 0.0, -0.0017057405784726143, -5.8412379075889476e-06, -0.00036769305006600916, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -0.015541746281087399, 0.0, -0.015397721901535988, -0.3734510540962219, 0.0, -3.6954195820726454e-05, -0.5104124546051025, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -0.004477357026189566, -0.00010442188795423135, -0.0019290901254862547, -1.4066597032069694e-05, -0.07889129221439362, 0.0, -0.0005229535745456815, 0.0, -0.03505251556634903, -0.023245446383953094, -0.29768118262290955, -0.052981238812208176, -0.0039155022241175175, -6.890059739816934e-05, -0.0012243640376254916, 0.0, 0.0, -0.30173563957214355, -0.3629243075847626, 0.0, -2.3841855067985307e-07, -3.099436753473128e-06, 0.0], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": -2.3841855067985307e-07, "The": -0.0030637490563094616, "▁Scottish": -0.023245446383953094, "▁Game": 0.0, "keep": 0.0, "ers": 0.0, "▁Association": -1.6689160474925302e-05, "▁has": -0.052981238812208176, "▁called": -6.794906312279636e-06, "▁for": 0.0, "▁a": 0.0, "▁public": 0.0, "▁inqu": 0.0, "iry": 0.0, "▁into": -1.9788545614574105e-05, "▁the": 0.0, "▁impact": -0.3609340190887451, "▁of": -0.015541746281087399, "▁re": -0.5179677605628967, "int": -0.00010442188795423135, "rodu": 0.0, "ced": -0.035052284598350525, "▁sea": -0.36088621616363525, "▁e": -0.07889129221439362, "ag": -4.768370445162873e-07, "les": 0.0, "▁on": -0.0017057405784726143, "▁east": -0.00036769305006600916, "▁coast": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "▁Scotland": 0.0, ",": -0.0005229535745456815, "▁after": -0.3734510540962219, "▁senior": -3.6954195820726454e-05, "▁cl": -0.5104124546051025, "erg": 0.0, "yman": 0.0, "▁was": 0.0, "▁injured": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "▁by": -0.004477357026189566, "▁an": -0.00010442188795423135, "▁attack": -0.0019290901254862547, "ing": -1.4066597032069694e-05, "agle": 0.0, "▁but": 0.0, "▁Government": -0.29768118262290955, "▁rejected": -0.0039155022241175175, "▁association": -0.0012243640376254916, "'": 0.0, "s": 0.0, "▁claim": -0.30173563957214355, "▁that": -0.3629243075847626, "▁birds": -2.3841855067985307e-07, "▁pose": -3.099436753473128e-06}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

The claim was made on the first day of a two-week review into some of the most controversial killings of the Troubles. The review is looking at 56 cases involving 97 deaths. They include killings by police officers and soldiers, and others where there are allegations of state collusion. A senior judge, Lord Justice Weir, is assessing what more needs to be done before inquests can be held to establish what happened. In his opening remarks, the judge said he hopes the review \"will shed some light on the cases without producing too much heat\". The review began with a discussion about so-called \"shoot to kill cases\", when RUC officers shot dead six unarmed republicans. A number of lawyers said the time taken by the police to disclose classified documents was the reason inquests had not yet taken place. A barrister for the PSNI said it simply does not have the resources to deal with the vast amount of material relating to legacy cases. But, a lawyer for the families of two of the men who were shot dead said they believe the PSNI is deliberately dragging its heels. Barry McDonald QC said the lack of disclosure of material by the PSNI was the biggest single impediment to the inquests taking place. \"Any time there is light at the end of the tunnel for the families, the PSNI extends the tunnel,\" he told the court. The killings of 10 unarmed Catholic civilians by the army in Ballymurphy in August 1971 were also discussed on Monday. It was revealed that the Ministry of Defence has told lawyers representing the families of those who were killed that it cannot identify the soldiers who were on duty in Ballymurphy at the time of the shootings. The court was told that so far, the Army has only managed to trace one soldier. Lord Justice Weir stressed the importance of the army witnesses being found. \"At the end of the day, we want to hear about the circumstances in which these people were shot, and those best placed to do that are those who shot them,\" he said. The judge said it was in everyone's interests that the soldiers who were there and fired shots came forward and explained why they did so. Lord Justice Weir has been asked to report on the state of readiness of each of the 56 legacy cases, and to identify which, if any, can proceed to inquest hearings. It will then be up to the Lord Chief Justice, Sir Declan Morgan, to decide what happens next. Likening the legacy inquests to spinning plates, the judge said \"there simply aren't enough resources to spin all of the plates all of the time\". He said he hopes the two week review will lead to an agreement about \"which plates need to spin more urgently\".\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nThe first day of a two-week review into some of the most controversial deaths during the Troubles heard that the PSNI is accused of trying to protect the reputation of the RUC.</s", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "The", "▁first", "▁day", "▁of", "▁a", "▁two", "-", "week", "▁review", "▁into", "▁some", "▁of", "▁the", "▁most", "▁controvers", "ial", "▁death", "s", "▁during", "▁the", "▁Tr", "ou", "bles", "▁heard", "▁that", "▁the", "▁PS", "NI", "▁is", "▁accused", "▁of", "▁trying", "▁to", "▁protect", "▁the", "▁reputation", "▁of", "▁the", "▁R", "UC", ".", "</s>"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.6758431792259216, -0.14195141196250916, -0.015407112427055836, 0.0, -4.6491513785440475e-06, -0.01892334595322609, -0.0008386432309634984, -4.541770613286644e-05, -2.3841855067985307e-07, -7.664863369427621e-05, -0.03429334983229637, 0.0, 0.0, -4.541770613286644e-05, -0.01539056096225977, -2.539125671319198e-05, -0.04694134742021561, 0.0, -8.964136941358447e-05, -2.539125671319198e-05, -2.3841855067985307e-07, -2.3841855067985307e-07, 0.0, -0.05272377282381058, -0.010342808440327644, -5.1616290875244886e-05, -0.07934276014566422, 0.0, -0.11737944185733795, -0.010824061930179596, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -0.6932473182678223, -8.344646857949556e-07, -8.344646857949556e-07, -2.2411095415009186e-05, -0.07889018952846527, 0.0, -5.960462772236497e-07, -8.583032467868179e-06, 0.0, -0.06484563648700714, -0.2524583637714386], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "The": -0.6758431792259216, "▁first": -0.14195141196250916, "▁day": -0.015407112427055836, "▁of": 0.0, "▁a": -4.6491513785440475e-06, "▁two": -0.01892334595322609, "-": -0.0008386432309634984, "week": -4.541770613286644e-05, "▁review": -2.3841855067985307e-07, "▁into": -7.664863369427621e-05, "▁some": -0.03429334983229637, "▁the": -5.960462772236497e-07, "▁most": -4.541770613286644e-05, "▁controvers": -0.01539056096225977, "ial": -2.539125671319198e-05, "▁death": -0.04694134742021561, "s": 0.0, "▁during": -8.964136941358447e-05, "▁Tr": -2.3841855067985307e-07, "ou": -2.3841855067985307e-07, "bles": 0.0, "▁heard": -0.05272377282381058, "▁that": -0.010342808440327644, "▁PS": -0.07934276014566422, "NI": 0.0, "▁is": -0.11737944185733795, "▁accused": -0.010824061930179596, "▁trying": -0.6932473182678223, "▁to": -8.344646857949556e-07, "▁protect": -8.344646857949556e-07, "▁reputation": -0.07889018952846527, "▁R": -8.583032467868179e-06, "UC": 0.0, ".": -0.06484563648700714, "</s>": -0.2524583637714386}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

But he has since found it difficult to get treatment, his marriage has failed and he is struggling to find work. For a number of nights each week, Mr Smith parks in a lay-by and sleeps in his car, to get away from people and control his anger management issues. \"I just don't like being around people sometimes I just want to close myself off. Basically I don't like living on people's sofas, I am not relying on people to put up with me. When I am depressed I would rather be alone so I've just got used to doing it now,\" he told the Victoria Derbyshire programme. \"I have got my quilt and stuff in the back and I have got my internal wifi here so it's like a mobile house.\" It is thought Mr Smith's PTSD was sparked after the vehicle patrol he was part of was blown up by roadside bombs twice in a week in 2005. The medically trained fusilier tried to help many of his colleagues who had received terrible injuries. \"I took a lot of guilt because obviously I thought I did my best at the time when I was treating them. I didn't really think they would die, I just thought they would be injured or go back home, but they passed away and obviously that was a big shock to us and I didn't know how to take that,\" he said. \"I became a bit scared then. I didn't know what to think or what my next step would be. Because it happened to me twice and I thought it will happen to me third time unlucky.\" The Ministry of Defence citation when he received his medal said: \"With no regard for his own safety and with his focus firmly on saving those in the vehicle, he commenced the evacuation of the casualties from the burning chaos.\" What is PTSD? Post-traumatic stress disorder is an anxiety disorder caused by witnessing or being involved in a frightening or distressing event. People naturally feel afraid when in danger, but the legacy of some traumatic events is a change in perception of fear. They may feel stressed or frightened in day-to-day life. Diagnosing PTSD But Mr Smith, now 31, blames himself for not being able to save his friends and does not think he deserves the medal. In fact, he does not really remember being awarded it by Prince Charles. \"I didn't really take it all in, I was very numb that day because I was on medication anyway so my mood and my temperament wasn't the best,\" he says. Figures from veterans' mental health charity Combat Stress show Mr Smith is not alone. It has seen a 28% increase in veterans seeking mental health support from April 2014 to 2015, treble the 9% increase seen the year before. Almost 6,000 are registered with the charity, and it says it has never been busier in its 97-year history.

At the end of the war, they began heading home. Most made it back safely, but for some the journey ended in tragedy. \"An event like this is hard to forget,\" says Eleni Karavelatzi. \"It leaves you seared with scars and makes you bitter forever.\" Eleni Karavelatzi was 12 months old when in 1942 her family fled the Nazi occupation of Kastelorizo, a Greek island 2km (1.5 miles) from the Turkish coast. They sailed first to Cyprus and then to a refugee camp in Gaza known as El Nuseirat. They stayed there until the end of the war. In September 1945, a British vessel, the SS Empire Patrol, left the Egyptian city of Port Said carrying Eleni's family and 500 other Greek refugees. Within hours, fire broke out onboard. Thirty-three passengers died, including 14 children. From her garden on Kastelorizo, Eleni can now see the EU border agency ship searching for new migrants and reminisces about what happened in 1945. \"My parents told me that I was tied with a rope and lowered on to a raft. But as they were letting me down, my father saw that it was full and ordered me back. As soon as I was brought up, a woman jumped on the dinghy. It capsized and all the children drowned.\" Among the victims were Eleni's three cousins, whose names are carved on a monument a short distance from where she lives. To the east of the monument lives Kastelorizo's only other survivor, Maria Chroni, who lives with her granddaughter. Maria Chroni, who was born in 1937, clung for life on a piece of wreckage. \"I found myself at sea holding on to a wooden plank.\" \"How it happened, I can't remember. I only know I that I stayed in this position for 10 hours. Then my father rescued me and lifted me into the charred boat.\" From Aleppo to Egypt and beyond Other Greek refugees had fled the Nazi occupation to Syria. They were mainly from the island of Chios, a few kilometres off the Turkey coast. \"The Germans were here and we were hungry. I was three back then,\" remembers Marianthi Andreadi. \"So we left for Turkey illegally and from there we took the train to Al Nayrab camp in Aleppo (Syria).\" Marianthi remembers some of the faces that stood out on her journey. \"I was surrounded by older women.

It gave them a 2-0 T20 series win to go with their 3-2 one-day series victory. \"The first half of the trip was very exciting,\" Bayliss said. \"But we got worse as the series went on, and South Africa got better.\" England won the four-match Test series 2-1 and took a 2-0 lead in the one-day international contest, before losing the final five fixtures on the tour (three ODIs and two T20s). Their batting collapsed dramatically at the Wanderers, with seven wickets falling for 14 runs and the bowlers were then subjected to an onslaught from De Villiers and Hashim Amla, who took their team to 121-0 after just eight overs. The South Africans struck 16 fours and nine sixes, with Amla unbeaten on 69 from 38 balls. Such an emphatic defeat was ominous for England, who begin their ICC World Twenty20 campaign against West Indies in Mumbai on 16 March and face South Africa two days later. \"It's a bit of a reminder for people at home not to get too far ahead of themselves,\" Bayliss admitted. \"We have played some good cricket, but this is a young group of players and performances like this will happen from time to time.\" The tourists changed their team for Sunday's match at the Wanderers, bringing in batsman Sam Billings for bowling all-rounder David Willey. \"In India we'll definitely be playing two spinners, so we just wanted to try having that extra batter, which we've done before, and just the five bowlers,\" Bayliss added. Asked about the effects of a long tour he added: \"I'm sure fatigue had a very small part to do with it, probably more mental than anything else. We've been away for five months apart from a week in between, when you count the UAE. \"But that's something these young players have got to get used to and if that's part of the learning curve for these young guys, there's something to learn from.\" England skipper Eoin Morgan, who was run out at the non striker's end for 38, lamented: \"Quite simply, we underperformed. \"The majority of our batting went really well - we were on course to get 185, 190, possibly 200. \"Myself and Jos Buttler were going really well, then we lost two wickets in two balls, and then from there we lost six wickets in the space of no time. I don't think we were too far behind the game, but the way we started with the ball allowed South Africa to get on top. \"The inconsistency is because we are inexperienced, and that is going to come.

McClair begins in the role on 1 June and will be responsible for implementing the SFA's performance strategy.

Both companies are majority-owned by the state. The announcement comes as Beijing tries to overhaul the steel industry, one of the country's bloated state sectors. The merger will create a new company, China Baowu Iron and Steel Group. Based on data from 2015, the two firms together have an annual production of about 60 million tonnes a year, which would make it the country's largest steelmaker. Globally, it would be second only to Luxembourg-based ArcelorMittal. Baosteel's net profit tumbled 83% to 1bn yuan ($150m) last year, while Wuhan lost 7.5bn yuan, a sharp drop from its 1.3bn yuan net profit in 2014. Steel demand in China, as well as worldwide, has slumped in the past year as the country's economic growth has slowed. The resulting overproduction has seen steelmakers around the world suffer huge losses. China has been accused of price dumping - selling its steel cheaply overseas in order to clear its stocks. In April, China promised to reduce its steel output, following a crisis meeting attended by 30 nations. Over the past 25 years, Chinese steel production has expanded hugely with output growing more than twelve-fold. China produced more than 822 million tonnes of steel in 2014 and is expected to produce even more this year. However, projected demand for its steel in 2016 is only 672 million tonnes.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nBaosteel is to take over Wuhan Iron and Steel, in a deal aimed at helping the Chinese state-owned steelmakers cope with the industry's downturn.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</s", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "B", "a", "ost", "e", "el", "▁is", "▁to", "▁take", "▁over", "▁Wu", "han", "▁Iron", "▁and", "▁Ste", "el", ",", "▁in", "▁a", "▁deal", "▁aim", "ed", "▁at", "▁helping", "▁the", "▁Chinese", "▁state", "-", "owned", "▁ste", "elm", "akers", "▁co", "pe", "▁with", "▁the", "▁industry", "'", "s", "▁dow", "nt", "urn", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "</s>"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.126740500330925, -0.00015937011630740017, -1.1920928244535389e-07, 0.0, 0.0, -0.3832356035709381, -0.009429913945496082, -0.0037149244453758, -0.00010513706365600228, -0.011009660549461842, 0.0, -3.576278118089249e-07, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.11753759533166885, -0.14581237733364105, -0.00011550712952157483, -0.008219700306653976, -0.3847467005252838, 0.0, -2.4318398573086597e-05, -0.02489214390516281, -0.28517627716064453, -0.7819581627845764, -0.006238155532628298, 0.0, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -0.1988620162010193, 0.0, -0.00036459474358707666, -0.05960209667682648, 0.0, 0.0, -0.11287250369787216, -0.27853256464004517, -0.007548972964286804, 0.0, -0.5180686116218567, 0.0, 0.0, -8.344646857949556e-07, -0.07951904088258743, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -0.25754594802856445, -0.10600944608449936, -0.05287563428282738, -0.06453846395015717, -0.06452091783285141, -0.1173514574766159, -0.5063595175743103, -0.5943968296051025, -0.5063595175743103, -0.5063595175743103, -0.36088523268699646], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": -0.5063595175743103, "B": -0.126740500330925, "a": -0.00015937011630740017, "ost": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "e": 0.0, "el": 0.0, "▁is": -0.3832356035709381, "▁to": -0.009429913945496082, "▁take": -0.0037149244453758, "▁over": -0.00010513706365600228, "▁Wu": -0.011009660549461842, "han": 0.0, "▁Iron": -3.576278118089249e-07, "▁and": 0.0, "▁Ste": 0.0, ",": -0.11753759533166885, "▁in": -0.14581237733364105, "▁a": -0.00011550712952157483, "▁deal": -0.008219700306653976, "▁aim": -0.3847467005252838, "ed": 0.0, "▁at": -2.4318398573086597e-05, "▁helping": -0.02489214390516281, "▁the": -0.11287250369787216, "▁Chinese": -0.7819581627845764, "▁state": -0.006238155532628298, "-": 0.0, "owned": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "▁ste": -0.1988620162010193, "elm": 0.0, "akers": -0.00036459474358707666, "▁co": -0.05960209667682648, "pe": 0.0, "▁with": 0.0, "▁industry": -0.27853256464004517, "'": -0.007548972964286804, "s": 0.0, "▁dow": -0.5180686116218567, "nt": 0.0, "urn": 0.0, ".": -8.344646857949556e-07, "</s>": -0.36088523268699646}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

A member of teaching staff in north Wales was given £100,000 compensation when the chair he sat on collapsed. The NASUWTteaching union said it had won £16,077,328 for members last year. A Department for Education spokesperson said: \"School employers are responsible for the health and safety of staff and pupils whether the local authority, governing body or academy trust, and they must adhere to the Health and Safety Act 1974.\" Teachers also received smaller payouts over accidents in the workplace, including a £55,000 package for a female member of staff in north-west England who tripped on a tear in the lino surface of her science classroom. She was later diagnosed with chronic back syndrome. NASUWT general secretary Chris Keates said many of the injuries would be reduced if employers \"took the welfare of staff seriously\" and followed good health and safety practices. She said: \"The consequence of negligence is careers, lives and health blighted and millions of pounds of public money spent in compensation. \"Unfortunately, there is no incentive for employers to take health and welfare seriously when they witness the government cutting funding for inspection and failing to take steps to secure compliance with the law. \"Failure to respect the rights of employees and to comply with employment law is also prevalent. \"Employers flout the law, but it's the teachers and the taxpayers who pay the price. \"While compensation is important, it can never make up for the fact that teachers suffer permanent physical and mental injury and often cannot continue in their chosen career.\" Separate data from the NUT, which keeps its overall compensation figures private, said there were two cases of personal injury compensation paid to its members last year. One included a £46,000 payout to a teacher who suffered \"severe psychological injury\" following \"a sustained campaign of bullying and harassment by senior leadership\". Another NUT member was awarded just under £4,500 after she fractured a finger on a defective doorknob, causing her long-term aches and a deformity. The union said it offered legal help in 130 cases last year, including 71 involving criminal activity and 57 in employment cases.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nTeachers in England and Wales have received almost £1m in compensation for injuries and illnesses caused by their work, with one teacher receiving £46,000 after a \"sustained campaign of bullying and harassment\" by senior leadership.\n\n\n</s", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "T", "each", "ers", "▁in", "▁England", "▁and", "▁Wales", "▁have", "▁received", "▁almost", "▁£", "1", "m", "▁in", "▁compens", "ation", "▁for", "▁inj", "uries", "▁and", "▁ill", "ness", "es", "▁caused", "▁by", "▁their", "▁work", ",", "▁with", "▁one", "▁teacher", "▁receiving", "▁£", "4", "6", ",", "0", "0", "0", "▁after", "▁a", "▁\"", "s", "ust", "ained", "▁campaign", "▁of", "▁bul", "lying", "▁and", "▁har", "ass", "ment", "\"", "▁by", "▁senior", "▁leadership", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "</s>"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.001947650802321732, 0.0, 0.0, -0.3901255130767822, -0.007301787380129099, 0.0, -4.6491513785440475e-06, -0.12903453409671783, -0.0077388472855091095, -0.6537594199180603, -0.0028986602555960417, -0.0003108495147898793, -0.0968213900923729, -3.6954811548639555e-06, -1.6212332411669195e-05, -8.583032467868179e-06, -0.010178917087614536, -0.0011398254428058863, 0.0, -0.05331549420952797, -0.00018094333063345402, -4.541770613286644e-05, -2.992108420585282e-05, -3.099436753473128e-06, -1.1920928244535389e-07, 0.0, -7.390948667307384e-06, -0.04953336715698242, -0.22795270383358002, -0.029811281710863113, -0.03556792810559273, -0.03506828472018242, -0.00016866691294126213, -3.6954811548639555e-06, 0.0, -0.00015841660206206143, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.0030957176350057125, -0.07912657409906387, -0.5787249803543091, -1.6689286894688848e-06, -0.0077765812166035175, 0.0, -2.145764938177308e-06, -2.0265558760002023e-06, -1.1920928244535389e-07, 0.0, -0.0023767100647091866, -2.50339189733495e-06, -1.9907753085135482e-05, -2.264974000354414e-06, -0.0019287331961095333, -0.0019453902496024966, -3.2186455882765586e-06, -0.052856072783470154, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -0.052715517580509186, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -0.3608860671520233], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "T": -0.001947650802321732, "each": 0.0, "ers": 0.0, "▁in": -3.6954811548639555e-06, "▁England": -0.007301787380129099, "▁and": -0.0023767100647091866, "▁Wales": -4.6491513785440475e-06, "▁have": -0.12903453409671783, "▁received": -0.0077388472855091095, "▁almost": -0.6537594199180603, "▁£": -0.00016866691294126213, "1": -0.0003108495147898793, "m": -0.0968213900923729, "▁compens": -1.6212332411669195e-05, "ation": -8.583032467868179e-06, "▁for": -0.010178917087614536, "▁inj": -0.0011398254428058863, "uries": 0.0, "▁ill": -0.00018094333063345402, "ness": -4.541770613286644e-05, "es": -2.992108420585282e-05, "▁caused": -3.099436753473128e-06, "▁by": -0.0019453902496024966, "▁their": 0.0, "▁work": -7.390948667307384e-06, ",": -0.00015841660206206143, "▁with": -0.22795270383358002, "▁one": -0.029811281710863113, "▁teacher": -0.03556792810559273, "▁receiving": -0.03506828472018242, "4": -3.6954811548639555e-06, "6": 0.0, "0": 0.0, "▁after": -0.0030957176350057125, "▁a": -0.07912657409906387, "▁\"": -0.5787249803543091, "s": -1.6689286894688848e-06, "ust": -0.0077765812166035175, "ained": 0.0, "▁campaign": -2.145764938177308e-06, "▁of": -2.0265558760002023e-06, "▁bul": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "lying": 0.0, "▁har": -2.50339189733495e-06, "ass": -1.9907753085135482e-05, "ment": -2.264974000354414e-06, "\"": -0.0019287331961095333, "▁senior": -3.2186455882765586e-06, "▁leadership": -0.052856072783470154, ".": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "</s>": -0.3608860671520233}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

The theft has been branded \"sickening\" by bird charity Birds of Poole Harbour. The group said some eggs - sometimes eaten as a delicacy - were not cleared for human consumption. Dorset Police and Natural England have launched an investigation. Natural England is urging any restaurants or pubs to ask to see a valid licence before buying eggs to prepare in meals. Birds of Poole Harbour had been surveying a group of islands in the harbour when the theft was discovered. Mediterranean gulls are classified as a Schedule One species, meaning anyone disturbing their nests must have a special licence. Paul Morton, who runs the charity, said Mediterranean gulls' eggs were not approved for human consumption, and could be a \"health issue\". \"I'm distraught, really. To see the taking of hundreds and hundreds of eggs from an important colony is quite sickening,\" he said. Mr Moreton said there had been previous convictions for egg poaching in the last 10 or 15 years. He said continued monitoring was needed to understand the effect on the gull population in the harbour, which he said had fallen by 70% since 2008.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nBirds of Poole Harbour have reported the theft of hundreds of Mediterranean gull and black-headed gull eggs from an important colony in Poole Harbour.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</s", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "B", "ird", "s", "▁of", "▁Po", "ole", "▁Har", "bour", "▁have", "▁reported", "▁the", "▁the", "ft", "▁of", "▁hundreds", "▁of", "▁Mediter", "rane", "an", "▁g", "ull", "▁and", "▁black", "-", "head", "ed", "▁g", "ull", "▁eggs", "▁from", "▁an", "▁important", "▁col", "ony", "▁in", "▁Po", "ole", "▁Har", "bour", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "</s>"], "token_logprobs": [-1.1920928244535389e-07, -0.23556484282016754, 0.0, -0.008533797226846218, -1.7881377516459906e-06, 0.0, 0.0, -1.1920928244535389e-07, 0.0, -0.07064960151910782, -0.19381344318389893, -0.254256933927536, -0.0015192406717687845, 0.0, 0.0, -0.00242475513368845, -8.344646857949556e-07, -0.028759058564901352, 0.0, 0.0, -0.0005536930402740836, 0.0, -0.0030541226733475924, 0.0, -0.006721151061356068, -0.0008411445305682719, 0.0, 0.0, -2.50339189733495e-06, -6.90197994117625e-05, -0.002046397188678384, -0.23729456961154938, -0.018915507942438126, -0.00019596086349338293, 0.0, -0.0002779574424494058, -7.271740287251305e-06, 0.0, -1.6689286894688848e-06, 0.0, -0.25193554162979126, -0.14293169975280762, -1.0609570381348021e-05, -0.0034593045711517334, -0.2054780125617981, -0.07096223533153534, -0.30223026871681213, -0.14267519116401672, -0.4287007451057434], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": -0.14267519116401672, "B": -0.23556484282016754, "ird": 0.0, "s": -0.008533797226846218, "▁of": -8.344646857949556e-07, "▁Po": -7.271740287251305e-06, "ole": 0.0, "▁Har": -1.6689286894688848e-06, "bour": 0.0, "▁have": -0.07064960151910782, "▁reported": -0.19381344318389893, "▁the": -0.0015192406717687845, "ft": 0.0, "▁hundreds": -0.00242475513368845, "▁Mediter": -0.028759058564901352, "rane": 0.0, "an": 0.0, "▁g": 0.0, "ull": -2.50339189733495e-06, "▁and": -0.0030541226733475924, "▁black": 0.0, "-": -0.006721151061356068, "head": -0.0008411445305682719, "ed": 0.0, "▁eggs": -6.90197994117625e-05, "▁from": -0.002046397188678384, "▁an": -0.23729456961154938, "▁important": -0.018915507942438126, "▁col": -0.00019596086349338293, "ony": 0.0, "▁in": -0.0002779574424494058, ".": -0.25193554162979126, "</s>": -0.4287007451057434}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

But the decision was not without controversy, sparking outrage among both UN members and women's rights advocates across the world. More than 1,000 of anonymous and \"concerned\" UN staff members have signed an online petition arguing that Wonder Woman was not an appropriate choice, noting the character's physique as: \"a large breasted, white woman of impossible proportions, scantily clad in a shimmery, thigh-baring body suit with an American flag motif and knee high boots -the epitome of a \"pin-up\" girl\". Critics who signed the petition said it was \"disappointing\" that the UN \"was unable to find a real-life woman that would be able to champion the rights of ALL women on the issue of gender equality and the fight for their empowerment\". The comic book superhero has sprung back into culture relevance with the upcoming release of a new Wonder Woman film starring Israeli actress Gal Gadot, who appeared at the UN ceremony along with actress Lynda Carter, who also portrayed her in the eponymous 1970s US TV series. Wonder Woman, an Amazonian princess who was created by Harvard-trained psychologist William Moulton Marston in 1941, was inspired by the leaders of the suffragist movement and has been long considered a feminist icon. \"The focus [of the UN] was on her feminist background, being the first female superhero in a world of male superheroes and that basically she always fought for fairness, justice and peace,\" UN official Maher Nasser told NPR. The organisation said the character's appointment was meant to \"highlight what we can collectively achieve if women and girls are empowered\" and \"to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls\", according to the UN's website on sustainable development goals. But the honour appeared to be ill-timed. The announcement follows the UN's selection of Portugal's Antonio Guterres as its next Secretary General despite a global push for the organisation to select its first female top diplomat. In fact, a recent analysis found that nine of 10 senior leadership roles at the UN went to men. Prospective female candidates in the race included the former prime minister of New Zealand, the director general of cultural agency Unesco, the Moldovan deputy prime minister and a senior EU official. Why wasn't a woman elected as UN secretary general? \"It is alarming that the United Nations would consider using a character with an overtly sexualized image at a time when the headline news in United States and the world is the objectification of women and girls,\" the petition read. About 100 UN staff members protested the appointment at UN headquarters, bearing signs emblazoned with the words: \"I am not a mascot\" and \"Let's get real\". Outrage reverberated across social media, with women's rights advocates pointing to real-life women who fit the bill over Wonder Woman. France's highest-ranking female Cabinet minister, Segolene Royal, told CBS \"Nobel Peace\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nThe UN has been criticized for naming Wonder Woman an honorary ambassador for women's empowerment and gender equality, with some calling the character's sexualized image inappropriate and others questioning why a real woman was not chosen for the role.</s", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "The", "▁UN", "▁has", "▁been", "▁critic", "ized", "▁for", "▁naming", "▁Wonder", "▁Woman", "▁an", "▁honor", "ary", "▁amb", "assador", "▁for", "▁women", "'", "s", "▁emp", "ower", "ment", "▁and", "▁gender", "▁equality", ",", "▁with", "▁some", "▁calling", "▁the", "▁character", "'", "s", "▁sexual", "ized", "▁image", "▁in", "app", "ropri", "ate", "▁and", "▁others", "▁question", "ing", "▁why", "▁a", "▁real", "▁woman", "▁was", "▁not", "▁chosen", "▁for", "▁the", "▁role", ".", "</s>"], "token_logprobs": [-2.3841855067985307e-07, -0.00013720047718379647, -0.06486775726079941, -0.008237434551119804, -0.8458515405654907, -0.028591090813279152, -6.890059739816934e-05, -4.756337511935271e-05, -0.13380135595798492, -2.0265558760002023e-06, -1.4305104514278355e-06, -0.004432139918208122, -0.0022247105371207, -8.583032467868179e-06, -0.0013565156841650605, -1.3708974620385561e-05, -0.0001037067049765028, -0.03513550013303757, -0.015384926460683346, 0.0, -0.26167184114456177, 0.0, 0.0, -0.786247968673706, -2.9802276912960224e-06, -1.9788545614574105e-05, -0.08107338845729828, -4.95898348162882e-05, -0.2327827513217926, -0.4535329043865204, -8.868777513271198e-05, -0.1651368886232376, -0.0766138806939125, 0.0, -0.14128974080085754, -0.11737827956676483, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -0.008759998716413975, -0.00010859376925509423, 0.0, -7.152555099310121e-07, -0.2387944906949997, -0.45150721073150635, -0.21147292852401733, 0.0, -0.00292397802695632, 0.0, 0.0, -0.004436531104147434, -1.6689286894688848e-06, 0.0, -0.07926864922046661, -3.6954811548639555e-06, 0.0, -1.6689286894688848e-06, 0.0, -0.023255812004208565], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": -2.3841855067985307e-07, "The": -0.00013720047718379647, "▁UN": -0.06486775726079941, "▁has": -0.008237434551119804, "▁been": -0.8458515405654907, "▁critic": -0.028591090813279152, "ized": -0.11737827956676483, "▁for": -3.6954811548639555e-06, "▁naming": -0.13380135595798492, "▁Wonder": -2.0265558760002023e-06, "▁Woman": -1.4305104514278355e-06, "▁an": -0.004432139918208122, "▁honor": -0.0022247105371207, "ary": -8.583032467868179e-06, "▁amb": -0.0013565156841650605, "assador": -1.3708974620385561e-05, "▁women": -0.03513550013303757, "'": -0.0766138806939125, "s": 0.0, "▁emp": -0.26167184114456177, "ower": 0.0, "ment": 0.0, "▁and": -0.2387944906949997, "▁gender": -2.9802276912960224e-06, "▁equality": -1.9788545614574105e-05, ",": -0.08107338845729828, "▁with": -4.95898348162882e-05, "▁some": -0.2327827513217926, "▁calling": -0.4535329043865204, "▁the": 0.0, "▁character": -0.1651368886232376, "▁sexual": -0.14128974080085754, "▁image": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "▁in": -0.008759998716413975, "app": -0.00010859376925509423, "ropri": 0.0, "ate": -7.152555099310121e-07, "▁others": -0.45150721073150635, "▁question": -0.21147292852401733, "ing": 0.0, "▁why": -0.00292397802695632, "▁a": 0.0, "▁real": 0.0, "▁woman": -0.004436531104147434, "▁was": -1.6689286894688848e-06, "▁not": 0.0, "▁chosen": -0.07926864922046661, "▁role": -1.6689286894688848e-06, ".": 0.0, "</s>": -0.023255812004208565}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

But on a sunny evening in Cheshire, Vaughan, joined by an England legends team including Malcolm, Neil Fairbrother and Adam Hollioake amongst others, turned out to take on Hawk Green's finest on their own turf. Having done a coaching session with the club's youngsters and a Q&A session the England Legends were put into bat first in this Twenty20 encounter, one of three matches the legends have scheduled in order to raise funds for grass roots cricket. Vaughan fell for 17 as the home side made an encouraging start with the ball but the form of Mal Loye, who top-scored for England Legends with 117, ensured the visitors set a tough mark of 194. It was a target which, despite Justin Blackhurst's impressive 88, proved to be too much for the Derbyshire and Cheshire League outfit, who could only make 165 in 20 overs to leave the legends once again victorious.

Ms Purvis told the BBC that had had no influence on her decision to step down. \"I think the clinic's well established here now, we're providing services more and more every year and I'm delighted to be remaining on the advisory board for the clinic. \"But I feel it's time to move on and I think it's time for Marie Stopes to get someone else in to manage the clinic and take it to new places,\" she said. \"At times it was difficult, particularly last year with the court case and the harassment, but I put that behind me and have concentrated on delivering services for women in Ireland both north and south. \"I think I've achieved a significant historical change in the perception of abortion in Northern Ireland from where the usual narrative was that abortion was illegal in Northern Ireland to now one where people understand that abortion is legal under certain circumstances. \"I think we've challenged the myths and stereotypes that are presented by those who are opposed to a woman's right to chose.\" Genevieve Edwards, director of policy for Marie Stopes UK, said: \"We were so lucky to have Dawn and wish her every success in whatever she chooses to do. \"The support for the clinic since it opened in very challenging circumstances has been heartening and a source of great comfort and pride for our staff and volunteers. \"We are now actively recruiting for Dawn's successor to lead us into the next phase of the clinic's journey.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\n\nDawn Purvis, who opened the first private abortion clinic in Northern Ireland, is stepping down after three years.\n\n\nPlease let me know if you need any more help.</s", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "D", "awn", "▁Pur", "vis", ",", "▁who", "▁opened", "▁the", "▁first", "▁private", "▁abort", "ion", "▁clin", "ic", "▁in", "▁Northern", "▁Ireland", ",", "▁is", "▁ste", "pping", "▁down", "▁after", "▁three", "▁years", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "Please", "▁let", "▁me", "▁know", "▁if", "▁you", "▁need", "▁any", "▁more", "▁help", ".", "</s>"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.9784825444221497, -0.023297740146517754, 0.0, -2.4437606043647975e-05, 0.0, -0.07946442812681198, -0.14528633654117584, -0.35399892926216125, -0.012644712813198566, -5.6265202147187665e-05, -0.001396633917465806, -0.005457739345729351, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.008928612805902958, -2.4914430468925275e-05, -0.00015352977789007127, -0.000316927267704159, -0.0024861162528395653, 0.0, 0.0, -0.02398836612701416, -2.8967437174287625e-05, 0.0, -0.0029708081856369972, -0.03513526916503906, -1.311301275563892e-06, -0.00727930199354887, -0.05538873001933098, -1.680836794548668e-05, 0.0, 0.0, -0.0008390005677938461, -0.0024947968777269125, -0.014229030348360538, -0.006421882193535566, -0.5063951015472412, -0.002822702983394265, -0.0324251763522625, -0.054996270686388016], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": -0.00727930199354887, "D": -0.023297740146517754, "awn": 0.0, "▁Pur": -2.4437606043647975e-05, "vis": 0.0, ",": -0.00015352977789007127, "▁who": -0.14528633654117584, "▁opened": -0.35399892926216125, "▁the": -0.012644712813198566, "▁first": -5.6265202147187665e-05, "▁private": -0.001396633917465806, "▁abort": -0.005457739345729351, "ion": 0.0, "▁clin": 0.0, "ic": 0.0, "▁in": 0.0, "▁Northern": -0.008928612805902958, "▁Ireland": -2.4914430468925275e-05, "▁is": -0.000316927267704159, "▁ste": -0.0024861162528395653, "pping": 0.0, "▁down": 0.0, "▁after": -0.02398836612701416, "▁three": -2.8967437174287625e-05, "▁years": 0.0, ".": -0.0324251763522625, "Please": -0.05538873001933098, "▁let": -1.680836794548668e-05, "▁me": 0.0, "▁know": 0.0, "▁if": -0.0008390005677938461, "▁you": -0.0024947968777269125, "▁need": -0.014229030348360538, "▁any": -0.006421882193535566, "▁more": -0.5063951015472412, "▁help": -0.002822702983394265, "</s>": -0.054996270686388016}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

But Madonna stole much of the attention on the red carpet, showing she is determined not to be overshadowed by the younger pop crowd. The queen of pop later sang Living For Love with a pack of horned male dancers before being lifted to the skies. Australian singer Sia - whose claim to fame is that she does not want to be famous - sang her hit Chandelier while facing the wall (right) while Bridesmaids actress Kristen Wiig and 12-year-old Maddie Ziegler danced in set made to look like a grotty, cluttered flat. Sia had earlier arrived in a conspicuous disguise, accompanied by Ziegler. Pharrell Williams was among the big winners, picking up three trophies as well as performing his song Happy while apparently dressed as a bell boy. When Beck won best album, Kanye West invaded the stage and threatened to launch a tirade, before apparently thinking better of it and going back to his seat. In 2009, he grabbed the microphone from Taylor Swift as she tried to accept a prize at the VMAs. Beck, who also won best rock album, performed a duet with Coldplay's Chris Martin. Taylor Swift got a hand with her dress on the red carpet. She missed out on the awards for record of the year and song of the year. The big-name pair-ups included Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga, who performed Irving Berlin's Cheek To Cheek. Rihanna arrived in a pink layered dress by Giambattista Valli. Katy Perry mingled with fans before swapping fashion tips (possibly) with Rihanna. Perry then changed clothes - and hair - to perform her ballad By the Grace of God as part of a poignant segment highlighting domestic abuse. Kanye West appeared in a single spotlight to perform Only One, which he wrote with Sir Paul McCartney. He later returned with Sir Paul and Rihanna to perform their joint collaboration FourFiveSeconds. Jessie J and Sir Tom Jones, former co-stars on The Voice UK, got together for a duet of You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'. Charli XCX (left) and Iggy Azalea were up for record of the year for their hit Fancy - but lost out to Sam Smith. Beyonce won three awards and also sang the gospel standard Take My Hand, Precious Lord. Rita Ora warmed up for her performance at the Oscars later this month with an appearance at the Grammys. Hard rock legends AC/DC opened the ceremony with Rock or Bust and Highway to Hell.

I had prepared for that but at times there was quite a bit of undue criticism of the team,\" adds the Down boss. \"Whenever I took the job, I lost maybe eight or 10 players and they were the most experienced players in the panel. \"So you are starting from scratch as such. You are having to start and build a panel and you are bringing in young and inexperienced players who might have played at minor and under-21 level. \"There is a massive step up from under-21 to having to play at senior level. But we worked away, we kept our heads down, we introduced quite a few players and the ball is starting to roll in the right direction for us.\" Burns believes the concluding league draw in Cork which kept Down in Division Two as Derry and Fermanagh suffered the drop was a key moment in his team's development. \"We knew we were going to have to get something when we were down there and it had been a long time since Down had got anything in Cork. \"We had a tough second half with them but we battled it out and the result kept us in Division Two and gave us a platform to build on in the lead-in to the championship.\" Despite avoiding the drop to join Armagh in Division Three, Down still went into the Ulster derby against the Orchard County on 4 June as underdogs but the Mournemen produced a composed second-half display to earn a deserved 0-15 to 2-7 victory. \"We knew if we performed on the day that we had a massive chance of beating Armagh.

A UK team has scanned each of its 360 bones into a computer and has digitally reconstructed the dinosaur. The specimen, nicknamed \"Sophie\", has been acquired by the Natural History Museum in London. Although Stegosauruses are one of the most well known dinosaurs, they are among those that scientists know the least about. There are only six partial skeletons of the creature, which lived around 150 million years ago. It could grow to the size of a minibus and the gigantic plates which ran along its back were its most distinctive feature. Surprisingly, it was 100 years ago that the dinosaur's skeleton was properly assessed and scientifically described. Now, using medical imaging techniques and 3D modelling, researchers at the Natural History Museum hope to learn much more about this iconic creature. Prof Paul Barrett, who is leading the research, said that they were particularly interested in finding out what stegosauruses used their plates for. \"We want to find out whether they were used for defence or whether they were used as a radiator to help the animal pick up or lose heat,\" he told BBC News. Sophie is 80% complete and is thought to be the most complete specimen in the world. Dr Charlotte Brassey, who is working with Prof Barrett, helped to scan in its 360 bones and digitally recreate it on her computer as a detailed 3D model. \"I reconstructed the skeleton to see what it might have looked like and then began to reconstruct the muscles and how they connected with the skeleton. From that we can begin to say how effective its muscles were and eventually in the future we would like to reconstruct how it moved,\" she told BBC News. Among the mysteries the researchers would like to solve is how the species was able to walk with such small front legs and such large back legs.

The SMC approved the drug after hearing that patients tended to be younger women with family and work commitments. Cancer Research UK said trials have shown that olaparib can extend lives by an average of seven months. Olaparib is already approved for use in England for people who are suffering with cancer for a third time. In Scotland, it will be used by women who have relapsed with cancer for a second time. Katherine Taylor, chief executive of research charity Ovarian Cancer Action, said: \"The SMC's decision to approve the routine use of olaparib is ground-breaking; a huge leap towards more personalised treatment for women facing ovarian cancer because of a genetic mutation.\" The drug targets ovarian cancer in women with a BRCA 1 or BRCA 2 gene mutation. Last year Angelina Jolie had her ovaries and fallopian tubes removed after she was found to be at an increased risk of ovarian cancer due to a \"faulty\" BRCA 1 gene. Ms Taylor warned that women in Scotland would only qualify for olaparib if their BRCA status is known. She said: \"NHS Scotland must continue to make sure that all patients are offered a BRCA test at diagnosis so they can be treated with the best drugs available.\" Gregor McNie, of Cancer Research UK in Scotland, said the charity was also funding clinical trials to asses the potential for olaparib in the treatment of brain tumours and pancreatic cancer. He added: \"Cancer Research UK scientists played a pivotal role in discovering and developing olaparib and it is great news that the drug will now offer new hope to some women in Scotland with advanced disease. \"We look forward to further good news on olaparib in the future, with clinical trials showing it also has potential in other types of cancer.\" Olaparib was approved by the SMC after being considered by its Patient Clinician Engagement (PACE) process which is used for medicines that treat end of life and very rare conditions. Prof Jonathan Fox, chairman of the SMC, said: \"As the first maintenance treatment for ovarian cancer, olaparib is an important development, and we know from the evidence given by patients and clinicians through our PACE process that it will be welcomed.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nThe Scottish Medicines Consortium has approved the use of olaparib, a drug that targets ovarian cancer, for use in Scotland after a \"groundbreaking\" decision.\n\n\n\n</s", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "The", "▁Scottish", "▁Medic", "ines", "▁Cons", "ort", "ium", "▁has", "▁approved", "▁the", "▁use", "▁of", "▁o", "la", "par", "ib", ",", "▁a", "▁drug", "▁that", "▁targets", "▁o", "var", "ian", "▁cancer", ",", "▁for", "▁use", "▁in", "▁Scotland", "▁after", "▁a", "▁\"", "ground", "bre", "aking", "\"", "▁decision", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "</s>"], "token_logprobs": [-3.576278118089249e-07, -0.21348516643047333, -8.821448318485636e-06, -1.1920928244535389e-07, 0.0, 0.0, -2.145764938177308e-06, -3.099436753473128e-06, -0.07889459282159805, -2.0503786799963564e-05, -0.005164140835404396, -0.05276798829436302, 0.0, -0.13544386625289917, -0.0005567907355725765, -2.3841855067985307e-07, 0.0, -0.02560514211654663, -0.006716414820402861, -0.033601969480514526, -0.006831503938883543, -0.002927187131717801, -0.2735729515552521, 0.0, -3.576278118089249e-07, -3.6954811548639555e-06, -0.024869468063116074, -0.10022157430648804, -0.00326825981028378, -3.0517112463712692e-05, -0.0005159238935448229, -0.2744996249675751, -0.2957476079463959, -0.11815500259399414, -2.7418097943154862e-06, -0.07889249920845032, 0.0, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -1.5497195136049413e-06, 0.0, -0.5063884854316711, -0.0001287377526750788, -0.21932223439216614, -0.003190310439094901, -0.3022271990776062], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": -0.003190310439094901, "The": -0.21348516643047333, "▁Scottish": -8.821448318485636e-06, "▁Medic": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "ines": 0.0, "▁Cons": 0.0, "ort": -2.145764938177308e-06, "ium": -3.099436753473128e-06, "▁has": -0.07889459282159805, "▁approved": -2.0503786799963564e-05, "▁the": -0.005164140835404396, "▁use": -0.00326825981028378, "▁of": 0.0, "▁o": -0.2735729515552521, "la": -0.0005567907355725765, "par": -2.3841855067985307e-07, "ib": 0.0, ",": -0.024869468063116074, "▁a": -0.2957476079463959, "▁drug": -0.033601969480514526, "▁that": -0.006831503938883543, "▁targets": -0.002927187131717801, "var": 0.0, "ian": -3.576278118089249e-07, "▁cancer": -3.6954811548639555e-06, "▁for": -0.10022157430648804, "▁in": -3.0517112463712692e-05, "▁Scotland": -0.0005159238935448229, "▁after": -0.2744996249675751, "▁\"": -0.11815500259399414, "ground": -2.7418097943154862e-06, "bre": -0.07889249920845032, "aking": 0.0, "\"": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "▁decision": -1.5497195136049413e-06, ".": 0.0, "</s>": -0.3022271990776062}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

McColgan said she felt excited to see her last record broken by Muir. She had earlier raised concerns about whether Muir's race had met all the criteria set by UK Athletics for record-breaking attempts. She had told BBC radio's John Beattie programme it needed to be a \"genuine race\" and may not have been as \"Muir had been the only competitor\". \"It was a mixed 3K race where all the other girls ran 3K and it was only Laura who finished the 5K,\" she said. \"We were wondering if to get a record ratified you have to have drug testing as well. \"So we were just wondering if they had everything in place to actually have it ratified as a record.\" However, British Athletics confirmed Muir's time was expected to be classified as official.

Rescuers found Sophia and Poppy 200m from a dam on the family's property. The Australian Broadcasting Corp. quoted Sophia's grandmother, Vera Cook, who credited the dog with saving the toddler's life. She said that Sophia was wearing just a nappy and T-shirt when she wandered off. \"The only thing I was thinking was well, hopefully the dog would have kept her warm,\" Ms Cook was quoted as saying. \"If [the dog] wasn't with her, I don't know whether they would have found her.\" The family issued a statement thanking emergency services and promising that Poppy would be \"well fed this evening\".\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\nA pet dog is being credited with keeping a little girl safe after the pair wandered away from their family home and could not be found for hours.\n\n###\nArticle: Meyiwa, 27, was shot on Sunday, apparently after burglars entered his girlfriend's house near Johannesburg. A suspect appeared in court on Friday and was charged with the murder of the popular goalkeeper. Meyiwa's death shocked South Africa and has highlighted the high rates of violent crime in the country. The funeral took place at the Moses Mabhida Stadium in Meyiwa's hometown of Durban. Many of the mourners were wearing T-shirts with a picture of Meyiwa, who was widely seen as an inspiring figure. Others wore red or black replica football shirts in the colours of Meyiwa's team, Orlando Pirates. Meyiwa's coffin was driven into the stadium, followed by Orlando Pirates players and officials. Mourners cried as videos were played showing Meyiwa training and playing football. Celebrating Senzo Meyiwa's life was the main theme for the tens of thousands of fans who packed into the stands. Fans from his team, the Orlando Pirates, but also from their rivals, the Kaiser Chiefs, sung Senzo's praises - both his ability on the pitch, and his behaviour off it. But there were also posters calling for justice for his killers, and a tougher stance from the South African authorities over gun-related violence. Underlying everything was a sense of injustice that one of Africa's most promising football talents could be killed in such a way. The chairman of the country's football association said he hoped that this could be a \"turning-point\" in the long-running debate over violent crime. And Senzo Meyiwa's father Sam told me he wanted more random searches, to cut the number of guns in South Africa. \"We are no longer safe in our houses,\" he said. \"The entire nation is crying. We have all lost. Our condolences to Orlando Pirates and Bafana Bafana,\" said Durban Mayor James Nxumalo, AFP reported, using a nickname for South Africa's national team. \"Our hearts are bleeding.\" President Zuma ordered the national flag to be flown at half-mast on Saturday to honour the goalkeeper. Following Meyiwa's death, South Africa's domestic football league postponed this weekend's scheduled Johannesburg derby between Orlando Pirates and rivals Kaiser Chiefs. The Durban stadium was also named as the venue for host South Africa's next Africa Cup of Nations qualifier. The funeral of another South African sporting hero, former 800m world champion Mbulaeni Mulaudzi, also took place on Saturday. Mulaudzi was killed in a car accident the day before Meyiwa's death. Police said on Friday that a suspect had been identified in Meyiwa's killing after an identity parade. The man, named as Zanokuhle Mbatha, 25, faced charges of murder and armed robbery at a court hearing and is due to appear again on 11 November. Police had offered a reward for information on the attack. \"There are still other suspects outstanding and we appeal to the public to continue providing information in support of the investigation,\" a police statement said.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nThousands of South Africans gathered at a stadium for the funeral of soccer star Senzo Meyiwa, who was killed in a burglary at his girlfriend's home.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "Th", "ous", "ands", "▁of", "▁South", "▁Afr", "icans", "▁gathered", "▁at", "▁a", "▁stad", "ium", "▁for", "▁the", "▁fun", "eral", "▁of", "▁s", "occer", "▁star", "▁Sen", "zo", "▁Mey", "i", "wa", ",", "▁who", "▁was", "▁killed", "▁in", "▁a", "▁burg", "l", "ary", "▁at", "▁his", "▁girl", "friend", "'", "s", "▁home", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁The", "▁", "2", "0", "-", "year", "-", "old", "▁woman", "▁was", "▁in", "▁a"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.214614138007164, 0.0, 0.0, -4.887569048150908e-06, -0.3692845106124878, -0.02329075336456299, 0.0, -0.14544209837913513, -0.06819388270378113, -0.01941276527941227, -0.00041714549297466874, 0.0, -0.7761797308921814, -2.3841855067985307e-07, 0.0, 0.0, -1.6689286894688848e-06, -0.05492676421999931, -5.960462772236497e-07, -0.9780477285385132, 0.0, 0.0, -3.1709168979432434e-05, 0.0, 0.0, -0.00020215852418914437, -9.989239333663136e-05, -0.00010442188795423135, -0.13104665279388428, -0.00570170721039176, -3.6954811548639555e-06, -0.0012903229799121618, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -0.00010442188795423135, -0.07745005190372467, -1.9788545614574105e-05, -2.3841855067985307e-07, -1.5497195136049413e-06, 0.0, 0.0, -0.03505251556634903, -0.06298179179430008, -0.17303362488746643, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -0.05330701544880867, 0.0, -1.597391747054644e-05, -3.0040289857424796e-05, -0.2520051896572113, -0.0005541696446016431, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -0.024717826396226883, -0.006894015707075596, -0.7493894696235657, -1.2182369232177734, -0.6932511329650879, -8.34461570775602e-06, -1.7762025890988298e-05, 0.0, -0.3084396719932556, -0.15375155210494995, -0.8984752297401428, -0.5080092549324036], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": -3.0040289857424796e-05, "Th": -0.214614138007164, "ous": 0.0, "ands": 0.0, "▁of": -1.6689286894688848e-06, "▁South": -0.3692845106124878, "▁Afr": -0.02329075336456299, "icans": 0.0, "▁gathered": -0.14544209837913513, "▁at": -0.07745005190372467, "▁a": -0.5080092549324036, "▁stad": -0.00041714549297466874, "ium": 0.0, "▁for": -0.7761797308921814, "▁the": -2.3841855067985307e-07, "▁fun": 0.0, "eral": 0.0, "▁s": -0.05492676421999931, "occer": -5.960462772236497e-07, "▁star": -0.9780477285385132, "▁Sen": 0.0, "zo": 0.0, "▁Mey": -3.1709168979432434e-05, "i": 0.0, "wa": 0.0, ",": -0.00020215852418914437, "▁who": -9.989239333663136e-05, "▁was": -0.15375155210494995, "▁killed": -0.13104665279388428, "▁in": -0.8984752297401428, "▁burg": -0.0012903229799121618, "l": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "ary": -0.00010442188795423135, "▁his": -1.9788545614574105e-05, "▁girl": -2.3841855067985307e-07, "friend": -1.5497195136049413e-06, "'": 0.0, "s": 0.0, "▁home": -0.03505251556634903, ".": -0.06298179179430008, "##": -0.05330701544880867, "#": 0.0, "Art": -0.2520051896572113, "icle": -0.0005541696446016431, ":": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "▁The": -0.024717826396226883, "▁": -0.006894015707075596, "2": -0.7493894696235657, "0": -1.2182369232177734, "-": -1.7762025890988298e-05, "year": -8.34461570775602e-06, "old": 0.0, "▁woman": -0.3084396719932556}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

The most disadvantaged pupils in Shanghai match the maths test results of wealthy pupils in the UK. Mr Schleicher says it \"debunks the myth that poverty is destiny\". On Monday, Education Secretary Michael Gove said individual schools in England should take Pisa tests, so that they could compare themselves against international standards. The latest Pisa - Programme for International Student Assessment - test results were published last year by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, ranking developed countries in terms of how well 15-year-olds performed in tests in reading, maths and science. Source: OECD This showed the UK as a middle-ranking country, with Asian school systems, such as in Singapore, South Korea and Shanghai and Hong Kong in China, as the highest performers. But Mr Schleicher's latest analysis compares the performance of the most deprived 10% of pupils. This reveals how the poorest in many countries overlap with the results of the wealthy in other countries. The poorest 10% of pupils in Shanghai are as good as the most privileged 20% of teenagers taking the test in the UK and the United States. In Europe, the Netherlands has the highest-performing pupils from the poorest families. Poor pupils in the Netherlands are as good at maths as much better-off teenagers in France. The poorest 10% of pupils in Hong Kong scored at a higher level than the wealthiest in Sweden and Norway. The very lowest performers among this group were in the Slovak Republic. Mr Schleicher says it shows how academic differences attributed to social background should not be unquestioningly tolerated. \"We tend to overestimate the impact of poverty,\" he says . There was also a challenge to the idea that the UK has an unusually poor record on social mobility. Dr John Jerrim at the Institute of Education published a study suggesting that in international terms the UK was mid-ranking in the link between family background and future employment opportunities - 17th out of 34 developed countries. There was greater equity in Scandinavia and some European countries, including Germany and the Netherlands. But Dr Jerrim said social mobility in the UK was not dissimilar to France, Spain and Italy - and the UK's record was better than some central and eastern European countries. \"Policymakers often state that the relationship between family background and labour market earnings is stronger in the UK than most other countries,\" he said. \"It is not true that we stand out compared to the rest of world. Policymakers should avoid making such exaggerated claims when discussing this politically sensitive issue.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nA study has found that poor pupils in some Asian countries perform as well as wealthy pupils in the UK and other Western countries, suggesting that poverty is not a destiny for children's future success.</s", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "A", "▁study", "▁has", "▁found", "▁that", "▁poor", "▁pup", "ils", "▁in", "▁some", "▁Asian", "▁countries", "▁perform", "▁as", "▁well", "▁as", "▁wealth", "y", "▁pup", "ils", "▁in", "▁the", "▁UK", "▁and", "▁other", "▁Western", "▁countries", ",", "▁suggesting", "▁that", "▁pover", "ty", "▁is", "▁not", "▁a", "▁dest", "iny", "▁for", "▁children", "'", "s", "▁future", "▁success", ".", "</s>"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.8437881469726562, -0.7613275051116943, -0.2736303508281708, -0.0005752577562816441, 0.0, -0.23568323254585266, -0.0003703146940097213, 0.0, -1.311301275563892e-06, -3.3854863431770355e-05, -0.00031859567388892174, -0.0004732680681627244, -0.0001597276859683916, -9.881961887003854e-05, 0.0, 0.0, -9.250213042832911e-05, -5.590759246842936e-05, -0.00025006983196362853, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.5324952602386475, -2.3841855067985307e-07, -0.10225963592529297, -0.006725887302309275, -0.005564319435507059, -0.03939959034323692, 0.0, -0.3700174391269684, 0.0, -0.0261023361235857, -7.152555099310121e-07, -0.25327256321907043, -1.0045932531356812, 0.0, -0.3507367670536041, -0.07302705943584442, -0.3609054386615753, 0.0, -0.5396725535392761, -4.0531076592742465e-06, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -0.043014414608478546], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "A": -0.8437881469726562, "▁study": -0.7613275051116943, "▁has": -0.2736303508281708, "▁found": -0.0005752577562816441, "▁that": 0.0, "▁poor": -0.23568323254585266, "▁pup": -0.00025006983196362853, "ils": 0.0, "▁in": 0.0, "▁some": -3.3854863431770355e-05, "▁Asian": -0.00031859567388892174, "▁countries": -0.006725887302309275, "▁perform": -0.0001597276859683916, "▁as": 0.0, "▁well": 0.0, "▁wealth": -9.250213042832911e-05, "y": -5.590759246842936e-05, "▁the": 0.0, "▁UK": 0.0, "▁and": -0.5324952602386475, "▁other": -2.3841855067985307e-07, "▁Western": -0.10225963592529297, ",": -0.005564319435507059, "▁suggesting": -0.03939959034323692, "▁pover": -0.3700174391269684, "ty": 0.0, "▁is": -0.0261023361235857, "▁not": -7.152555099310121e-07, "▁a": -0.25327256321907043, "▁dest": -1.0045932531356812, "iny": 0.0, "▁for": -0.3507367670536041, "▁children": -0.07302705943584442, "'": -0.3609054386615753, "s": 0.0, "▁future": -0.5396725535392761, "▁success": -4.0531076592742465e-06, ".": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "</s>": -0.043014414608478546}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

The US central bank also said it expected a \"slower path\" for future rate rises. It raised rates in December for the first time in nearly a decade. On the 23 June UK referendum on whether to stay in the European Union, Ms Yellen said: \"Clearly this is a very important decision for the United Kingdom and for Europe. \"It is a decision that could have consequences for economic and financial conditions in global financial markets. \"If it does so it could have consequences in turn for the US economic outlook that would be a factor in deciding on the appropriate path of policy,\" she added. Meanwhile, the US Treasury cleared all bond sales on the 23 June. Lou Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson ICAP, told Bloomberg Business that the Treasury alters its auctions calendar to avoid Fed monetary policy announcements, and that the UK referendum was a \"similar kind of market event\". Fed policymakers did not reveal when rates might rise, but the door has been left open for an increase when they next meet at the end of July. Chair Yellen added: \"Proceeding cautiously and raising our interest-rate target will allow us to verify that economic growth will return to a moderate pace, that the labor market will strengthen further, and that inflation will continue to make progress toward our 2% objective.\" The Fed said in a statement that the pace of improvement in the labour market had slowed. The bank added, however, that \"economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labour market indicators will strengthen\" even with gradual rate increases. Analysis: Andrew Walker, BBC News The key consideration in this decision was the US jobs market - with a little help from the uncertainties arising from the forthcoming British referendum and a few other factors. We have had two months where job creation has been disappointing, especially May. The Fed Chair Janet Yellen called it \"something of a loss of momentum\". But she also said signs there were signs that the labour market is \"approaching maximum employment\" and it's important not to attach too much importance to one data point. She - and, she said, the Fed's policy making committee - did not feel that \"progress in the labour market has come to an end\". Which leaves us (or at least me) having to pore over the next jobs report to see how likely a rate rise is in July. At this stage it doesn't look very likely, but it is not altogether off the table. The dollar fell against the euro and sterling, but Wall Street held on to earlier gains, with the S&P 500 up 0.3%. The Fed expected the unemployment rate to stand at 4.7% by the end of this year, before falling to 4.6% in 2017 and remain at that level in 2018. In May, US job creation fell to its lowest level in more than five years,\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nThe US Federal Reserve has kept interest rates on hold due to uncertainties surrounding the UK's EU referendum and a slowdown in the US jobs market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "The", "▁US", "▁Federal", "▁Reserve", "▁has", "▁kept", "▁interest", "▁rates", "▁on", "▁hold", "▁due", "▁to", "▁un", "cert", "aint", "ies", "▁surrounding", "▁the", "▁UK", "'", "s", "▁EU", "▁refer", "endum", "▁and", "▁a", "▁slow", "down", "▁in", "▁the", "▁US", "▁jobs", "▁market", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>"], "token_logprobs": [-0.00010442188795423135, -3.731181277544238e-05, -1.3232143828645349e-05, -2.038458114839159e-05, -0.00010144196130568162, -0.03117142803966999, -0.0012980615720152855, -4.6132929128361866e-05, -1.6689286894688848e-06, -0.4289188086986542, 0.0, -0.03322139009833336, 0.0, -0.6283048391342163, -4.768370445162873e-07, -8.535020606359467e-05, -0.0023701691534370184, -0.09762116521596909, -3.0278701160568744e-05, -0.00017832119192462415, -6.568216485902667e-05, 0.0, -0.057556379586458206, -0.00015901254664640874, -0.3189481198787689, -0.0015345951542258263, -0.00590567896142602, -0.3381665349006653, -0.0005536930402740836, 0.0, -0.1862671822309494, -0.00010597144137136638, -0.008280588313937187, -1.4305104514278355e-06, -0.00010489867418073118, -0.0789080336689949, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -0.0007674132939428091, -0.00029023250681348145, -0.035241033881902695, -0.1173785924911499, -0.3608877956867218, -0.11735167354345322, -0.0645250529050827, -0.11735103279352188, -0.023245446383953094, -0.005455842707306147, -0.008264390751719475, -0.0008386432309634984, -0.003600069787353277, -0.0008386432309634984, -0.0006809299811720848, -0.00036459474358707666, -0.00015841660206206143, -5.602820692729438e-06, -0.00024029705673456192, -6.890059739816934e-05, -0.00010442188795423135, -4.541770613286644e-05, -2.992108420585282e-05, -8.487341256113723e-05, -0.00024029705673456192, -5.602820692729438e-06, -1.2993727978027891e-05], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": -1.2993727978027891e-05, "The": -3.731181277544238e-05, "▁US": -0.00010597144137136638, "▁Federal": -2.038458114839159e-05, "▁Reserve": -0.00010144196130568162, "▁has": -0.03117142803966999, "▁kept": -0.0012980615720152855, "▁interest": -4.6132929128361866e-05, "▁rates": -1.6689286894688848e-06, "▁on": -0.4289188086986542, "▁hold": 0.0, "▁due": -0.03322139009833336, "▁to": 0.0, "▁un": -0.6283048391342163, "cert": -4.768370445162873e-07, "aint": -8.535020606359467e-05, "ies": -0.0023701691534370184, "▁surrounding": -0.09762116521596909, "▁the": -0.1862671822309494, "▁UK": -0.00017832119192462415, "'": -6.568216485902667e-05, "s": 0.0, "▁EU": -0.057556379586458206, "▁refer": -0.00015901254664640874, "endum": -0.3189481198787689, "▁and": -0.0015345951542258263, "▁a": -0.00590567896142602, "▁slow": -0.3381665349006653, "down": -0.0005536930402740836, "▁in": 0.0, "▁jobs": -0.008280588313937187, "▁market": -1.4305104514278355e-06, ".": -0.00010489867418073118}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

Mr Holmes opened fire during the midnight premiere of a Batman film in Aurora, Colorado, in July 2012. Officials say he was wearing body armour, threw smoke canisters and shot at people trying to escape. If the jury finds him not guilty on grounds of insanity, he will spend the rest of his life in a mental institution for the criminally insane. Otherwise he faces the death penalty. During opening statements on Monday, District Attorney George Brauchler said both mental health evaluators agreed on Mr Holmes' mental state at the time of the attack. \"Both of them said the same thing - that the guy was sane when he tried to murder all those people in the theatre,\" he said. Prosecutors have argued the attack was clearly premeditated, with Mr Holmes planning and amassing weapons for months, as well as elaborately booby-trapping his apartment to kill anyone who tried to enter. His parents wrote a letter to the Denver Post in December calling for his life to the spared. Robert and Arlene Holmes said their son was \"not a monster\", but suffers from severe mental illness. The trial comes after two and a half years of complicated legal questions related to the death penalty and the insanity plea, and after nearly three months of jury selection. The mental health evaluations could be a key factor. Judge Carlos Samour ordered a second mental health exam after prosecutors said the first one was biased. Defence lawyers objected to a second test. At the time of the shooting, Mr Holmes was a graduate student in neuroscience at the University of Colorado in Denver, but was withdrawing from his studies after failing a key exam. When he was arrested, Mr Holmes' hair had been dyed red in an apparent reference to the Joker, a Batman villain. He appeared dazed in his first court appearance, and cameras were banned from further hearings.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nJames Holmes, the man who killed 12 people at a Batman screening in Colorado, has pleaded guilty to the crimes but insists he was insane at the time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</s", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "James", "▁Hol", "mes", ",", "▁the", "▁man", "▁who", "▁killed", "▁", "1", "2", "▁people", "▁at", "▁a", "▁Bat", "man", "▁screen", "ing", "▁in", "▁Colorado", ",", "▁has", "▁ple", "aded", "▁guilty", "▁to", "▁the", "▁cr", "imes", "▁but", "▁ins", "ists", "▁he", "▁was", "▁ins", "ane", "▁at", "▁the", "▁time", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "</s>"], "token_logprobs": [-1.1920928244535389e-07, -0.1690082848072052, 0.0, 0.0, -0.1466374397277832, -0.5143325328826904, -0.00021443451987579465, -0.004433208145201206, -0.00019810620869975537, -4.5536911784438416e-05, 0.0, 0.0, -3.933898824470816e-06, -0.035744503140449524, -0.00020454221521504223, -0.0002574589161667973, 0.0, -0.0028080816846340895, 0.0, -0.00546271912753582, -0.1440071165561676, -0.2534343898296356, -0.0003618539194576442, -0.08062424510717392, -2.50339189733495e-06, -0.5071315169334412, -0.8548373579978943, -0.0009511952521279454, -0.4500811696052551, 0.0, -0.1173921674489975, -0.37824130058288574, -0.001515788841061294, -0.00042083943844772875, -0.0005529781919904053, -6.031808152329177e-05, 0.0, -0.036011554300785065, -1.0728830375228426e-06, 0.0, -0.00463933777064085, -0.11784321814775467, -0.0008391196606680751, -0.008110800758004189, -0.006811139173805714, -0.04300173744559288, -0.07888985425233841, -0.03505251556634903, -0.018914923071861267, -0.015384926460683346, -0.05270036309957504, -0.012509571388363838, -0.018914923071861267, -0.05270036309957504], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": -0.018914923071861267, "James": -0.1690082848072052, "▁Hol": 0.0, "mes": 0.0, ",": -0.2534343898296356, "▁the": -1.0728830375228426e-06, "▁man": -0.00021443451987579465, "▁who": -0.004433208145201206, "▁killed": -0.00019810620869975537, "▁": -4.5536911784438416e-05, "1": 0.0, "2": 0.0, "▁people": -3.933898824470816e-06, "▁at": -0.036011554300785065, "▁a": -0.00020454221521504223, "▁Bat": -0.0002574589161667973, "man": 0.0, "▁screen": -0.0028080816846340895, "ing": 0.0, "▁in": -0.00546271912753582, "▁Colorado": -0.1440071165561676, "▁has": -0.0003618539194576442, "▁ple": -0.08062424510717392, "aded": -2.50339189733495e-06, "▁guilty": -0.5071315169334412, "▁to": -0.8548373579978943, "▁cr": -0.4500811696052551, "imes": 0.0, "▁but": -0.1173921674489975, "▁ins": -6.031808152329177e-05, "ists": -0.001515788841061294, "▁he": -0.00042083943844772875, "▁was": -0.0005529781919904053, "ane": 0.0, "▁time": 0.0, ".": -0.00463933777064085, "</s>": -0.05270036309957504}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

It is now returning what remains of the original $20m (Â£13m) donation. Mr Cosby denies any wrongdoing and has not been charged with any crime. The Cosby family donated the money to the women's college in 1988 and the endowed professorship was established in the name of Mr Cosby and his wife, Camille. Mr Cosby, 78, is facing a series of historic sexual assault allegations dating back several decades. Recently released court documents from a 2005 civil case show he had admitted obtaining sedatives to give to women before sex. But Mr Cosby's lawyers said he was only one of many people who introduced the sedatives - Quaaludes - into their \"consensual sex life in the 1970s\". They said that at no point had Mr Cosby admitted to having any non-consensual sex or giving any women drugs without their knowledge. \"Quaaludes were a highly popular recreational drug in the 1970s, labelled in slang as 'disco biscuits', and known for their capacity to increase sexual arousal,\" a statement said. Mr Cosby's legal team is attempting to stop a judge unsealing the full set of documents from the case, including the confidential settlement agreement. More than 12 women have accused Mr Cosby of sexual assault, but he has denied all of the claims. 2002: Lachele Covington, a 20-year-old actress, reportedly files a police report saying she had been inappropriately touched. No further action was taken. 2005: Andrea Constand sues Mr Cosby for sexual assault. The case is eventually settled out of court in 2006. 2014: Over the year, dozens of women make public accusations that Mr Cosby sexually assaulted them.

Repeats of the Cosby Show are also pulled from cable TV December 2014: Judy Huth sues Mr Cosby for molesting her in 1974 when she was 15 years old. Mr Cosby counter-sues, claiming she is trying to extort money from him May 2015: Mr Cosby speaks publicly about the allegations for the first time. \"I can't speak; I just don't want to argue; I don't talk about it,\" he told ABC News.

The deal depends on Aermont, which runs property investment funds, securing financing in the next four weeks. Pinewood's 007 stage is one of the world's largest and was used to film parts of Spectre and Skyfall. Some of Star Wars: The Force Awakens was also filmed at Pinewood in Buckinghamshire. However, Harrison Ford, the actor who plays Han Solo, was injured when the door of the Millennium Falcon closed on him and broke his leg. Goodweather Investment Management, which is owned by property investors Peel Holdings, and Warren James Holdings, owner of the eponymous jewellery chain, together control 65% of Pinewood Group and have agreed to the cash sale providing the buyer secures financing. The prospective new owner intends to keep the existing management in place, led by chief executive Ivan Dunleavy. The company has film and TV studios all over the world including in the US, Canada, Malaysia and the Dominican Republic. Earlier this year, Pinewood Group retained investment bank Rothschild to examine its strategic options. In the past, it had been constrained from raising additional funding for investment via the stock exchange.

As a result, it says it will offer five times more sustainable chocolate in the UK by 2019. But critics warn this could confuse consumers. They also fear that shared standards around ethical trade will be lost if more firms drop Fairtrade. So what prompted Mondelez's change of approach, and does it leave the future of the Fairtrade mark in doubt? Broadly, Fairtrade works as a voluntary certification system which holds adherents to strict standards - in particular paying a minimum price for raw materials such as cocoa, sugar and coffee. But Glenn Caton, northern Europe president at Mondelez, tells the BBC that while his firm and Fairtrade have the same goals, \"sustainability is about much more to us than price\". \"The next generation of farmers aren't taking on cocoa farming like they used to because it is so unprofitable, so we have to make sure their communities thrive and this means investing more in their communities,\" he says. As such, Mondelez wants to lead its own sustainability efforts - investing more in areas such as its supply chain, bonuses for farmers, training and climate change prevention. The Fairtrade Foundation has welcomed the move, too, which it says will leave farmers in developing countries like Ghana at least as well off, if not better-off. \"The relationship is not ending, it's changing,\" says policy and public affairs director Barbara Crowther, pointing out that the Fairtrade Foundation will remain a partner to Cocoa Life - independently assessing its progress and reporting its findings. The big question now is whether other firms will also choose to abandon Fairtrade certification and adopt their own systems of self-regulation. Certainly criticism of the Fairtrade system is mounting in the cocoa industry, says Dr Steve Davies of the Institute of Economic Affairs. The big issue is that most cocoa producers are small farmers who can't achieve the economies of scale of bigger farms, and that leaves many vulnerable to risks like drought and struggling to survive. \"Fairtrade does bring benefits to some producers, but it will not be a way of transforming the world trade system as some people seem to see it,\" he says. \"The only way to improve conditions for people working at bottom of the supply chain - those farming raw materials like cocoa - is by investing in the supply chain. Price floors might help but will only go so far.\" Another issue, says Tobias Webb, of supply chain consultancy the Innovation Forum, is that firms can find the web of overlapping ethical trade certifications out there complex to manage.

In the end, the list of those wanting to pay respect Castro in person appears to be very short, with some notable allies choosing to send representatives instead. So who is making the trip to Havana? Perhaps most surprisingly, considering the two countries' long friendship, Russian President Vladimir Putin has said he will not be attending. His spokesman said he was too busy to travel to Cuba but that Russia would be sending a representative. Less surprising is US President Barack Obama's decision to stay away. Despite the steps Mr Obama made towards fixing US-Cuban relations, Castro remains a divisive figure - not least for Cuban-Americans who fled his rule. The White House will not send an official delegation, but Mr Obama's pick for ambassador to Cuba, Jeffrey DeLaurentis, and deputy national security adviser, Ben Rhodes, will attend the commemorative event. UK Prime Minister Theresa May, France's President Francois Hollande and German Chancellor Angela Merkel are all staying away. However, they will be sending government representatives. Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry will attend to represent the UK's Labour Party. Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau - whose late father Pierre was friends with Mr Castro - was one of the few Western leaders to release a message of condolences following the leader's death, but will not be attending. Governor-General David Johnston was attending Tuesday's commemoration. China's President Xi Jinping paid his respects at the Cuban embassy in Beijing, saying the country had lost a \"close comrade and real friend\". Vice President Li Yuanchao is representing China at the commemorations in Cuba. Despite their close friendship, Vietnam's President Tran Dai Quang will also not be attending, sending National Assembly chairwoman Nguyen Thi Kim Nga in his place. The country will be holding a national day of mourning for Castro, however. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi - who paid tribute to an \"iconic\" world leader last week - will be sending his home minister but will not be flying to Cuba himself. North Korea's Kim Jung-un will not be travelling to Cuba either, sending a delegation on his behalf. The list of world leaders actually attending is relatively short. A number of South American leaders will be making the trip: Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro, whose late mentor Hugo Chavez had a special bond with Castro, Ecuador's Rafael Correa, Bolivia's Evo Morales and Nicaragua's Daniel Ortega have all indicated they will attend. Also expected are Salvadorean President Salvador Sanchez Ceren and Mexico's President Enrique Pena Nieto. At least two southern African presidents will also fly to Cuba, South Africa's Jacob Zuma, who has just survived a vote of confidence, and Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe, whose country has just brought in a new currency. And it seems the European Union may be represented by just one leader, in the form of Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras. Other notable Europeans attending include Ireland's Gerry Adams and Spain's ex-King Juan Carlos.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nThe list of world leaders attending Fidel Castro's funeral is shaping up to be a mixed bag, with some notable absences and last-minute decisions.\n\n\n</s", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "The", "▁list", "▁of", "▁world", "▁leaders", "▁att", "ending", "▁F", "idel", "▁Castro", "'", "s", "▁fun", "eral", "▁is", "▁sh", "aping", "▁up", "▁to", "▁be", "▁a", "▁mixed", "▁bag", ",", "▁with", "▁some", "▁notable", "▁abs", "ences", "▁and", "▁last", "-", "min", "ute", "▁dec", "isions", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "</s>"], "token_logprobs": [-5.960462772236497e-07, -0.6183472871780396, -1.08418869972229, 0.0, -0.01252193283289671, 0.0, -0.004076505079865456, -3.2186455882765586e-06, -0.3724292516708374, -2.0861407392658293e-05, -0.00014256415306590497, -1.1920928244535389e-07, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.5682437419891357, -0.5108617544174194, 0.0, -1.2993727978027891e-05, -6.9141146923357155e-06, -7.152555099310121e-07, -0.21084238588809967, -0.00017867876158561558, -0.0014692475087940693, -2.52720492426306e-05, -2.0265558760002023e-06, -0.0032594669610261917, -0.0001760566228767857, -0.0005023409612476826, -0.2519303262233734, -0.5101167559623718, -0.07191275805234909, -2.3841855067985307e-07, -1.1920928244535389e-07, 0.0, -0.20965607464313507, 0.0, -0.12341058999300003, -0.14269617199897766, -0.00024029705673456192, -0.011840539053082466, -0.11735251545906067], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": -0.011840539053082466, "The": -0.6183472871780396, "▁list": -1.08418869972229, "▁of": 0.0, "▁world": -0.01252193283289671, "▁leaders": 0.0, "▁att": -0.004076505079865456, "ending": -3.2186455882765586e-06, "▁F": -0.3724292516708374, "idel": -2.0861407392658293e-05, "▁Castro": -0.00014256415306590497, "'": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "s": 0.0, "▁fun": 0.0, "eral": 0.0, "▁is": -0.5682437419891357, "▁sh": -0.5108617544174194, "aping": 0.0, "▁up": -1.2993727978027891e-05, "▁to": -6.9141146923357155e-06, "▁be": -7.152555099310121e-07, "▁a": -0.21084238588809967, "▁mixed": -0.00017867876158561558, "▁bag": -0.0014692475087940693, ",": -2.52720492426306e-05, "▁with": -2.0265558760002023e-06, "▁some": -0.0032594669610261917, "▁notable": -0.0001760566228767857, "▁abs": -0.0005023409612476826, "ences": -0.2519303262233734, "▁and": -0.5101167559623718, "▁last": -0.07191275805234909, "-": -2.3841855067985307e-07, "min": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "ute": 0.0, "▁dec": -0.20965607464313507, "isions": 0.0, ".": -0.12341058999300003, "</s>": -0.11735251545906067}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

It said it was still trying to expand to China. The other exceptions are North Korea, Syria and Crimea, where it is banned from operating by US law. The announcement was made by the firm's chief executive Reed Hastings at his keynote speech at the CES tech show in Las Vegas. He also confirmed that Netflix would begin offering HDR (high dynamic range) content later this year. The company's shares closed the day more than 9% higher. \"We were expecting Netflix to go everywhere, but this has happened more quickly than we thought,\" commented Fernando Elizalde from the tech consultancy Gartner. \"Until now, the firm had been doing it in phased stages because of the costs of marketing and dubbing or subtitling the content. \"But it's worth remembering that in some of the emerging economies it will only be people in urban areas that will be able to use it because of limited internet availability.\" Mr Hastings said Netflix was in talks with the Chinese government, but acknowledged it would take time to reach an agreement. \"It's a very large country, you know a billion Chinese that we want to give access to the Netflix content,\" he said. \"In China you need specific permission from the government to operate, so we are continuing to work on that and we are very patient.\" But one company watcher had doubts. \"China is going to be a tough nut to crack given that that three strong domestic services already exist,\" said Mike Goodman from Strategy Analytics. As part of its expansion, Netflix has added support for Korean, Chinese and Arabic to its list of supported languages. That brings the total number - in which the firm provides subtitles, captions and alternative audio - to 21 languages. Mr Hastings added that Netflix would initially focus on expanding the reach of its existing content rather than commissioning extra locally-made shows. For consumers who already have Netflix, the biggest change may be the addition of HDR. High dynamic range video allows compatible TVs to show millions more colours and a wider dynamic range - added shades of brightness in between black and white - letting more detail be shown. Many experts believe the impact is greater than that of just jumping from 1080p to 4K ultra-high definition resolution alone. One consequence of using the format, however, is that it requires more data, and few TVs support it yet. Mr Hastings said users with compatible TVs should get a \"visceral sensation that's pretty amazing\". The firm's rival, Amazon, began streaming a limited number of shows in the format in 2015. Audience members at the Las Vegas event were also given a first look at some of the service's forthcoming shows, including: Ironically, the clips were blocked for those watching a live stream of the event. The firm also teased Chelsea Does..., a documentary series presented by the comedian Chelsea Handler that will cover topics including drugs, racism, marriage and Silicon Valley.

He faced smuggling charges but was found guilty of a lesser charge of 'endangering life' because he hid the girl in an unsafe way in a van. Lawrie will have to pay the 1,000-euro (Â£754) fine if convicted of another offence. The decision was met with applause from supporters in the courtroom. The former carpet cleaner, who disclosed he had bipolar disorder and Tourette's Syndrome, said he acted \"stupidly\". Before the case started he appeared with the child on his lap at a media conference in the French town. Lawrie said he feared \"being made an example of\" by the court. He told the assembled media: \"They see the media attention I have been getting and I think it could go one of two ways. \"France has an opportunity to show, as I know they are, a compassionate country.\" Lawrie said he regretted his actions and would not repeat the effort. He told the court he had acted stupidly and irrationally in hiding Bru in the sleeping compartment. Speaking via an interpreter, he told the judge: \"I saw the little girl and her father in the work that I was doing. That night I just could not leave her there any more. \"It was wrong. It was the most stupid conceived plan.\" Lawrie rejected the idea that he was trafficking for money, telling the judge: \"Her father is a farmer from Afghanistan. He doesn't have any money whatsoever.\" The aid worker was stopped in Calais as he returned home in October 2015. The former Army physical training instructor said he was helping build shelters in The Jungle camp when he got to know Bru and her father asked him to help get her to close family members living legally in Leeds. He said he was not a hero but \"an unemployed carpet cleaner from Leeds\" who wanted to help and had never been in trouble before. He told reporters his actions had left him penniless and on the edge of bankruptcy after giving up to Â£8,000 of his own money as well as collecting donations for the refugees.

At a meeting of the Association of Chief Police Officers in January, it was announced that 37 out of 44 forces had signed up to the new system. Critics say the rules are a money-making exercise and allow law breaking. Previously, only those travelling at up to 10% above the limit plus 6mph could be offered one of the courses. But the amendments were agreed by chief constables at a meeting of the Association of Chief Police Officers in January. For a 30mph zone, the upper limit for a speeding course would be 42mph. This would rise to 86mph for motorways and other major roads, although the official limit remains the same. Acpo said the figure at which a course could be offered was a decision for individual forces, and not all would make it available for higher speeds. Drivers can only attend one speed awareness course, costing between Â£60 and Â£100, in a three-year period. \"There is evidence to show that if people are sent on educational courses, rather than being punished with a fine and penalty points on their driving licence, they are less likely to reoffend in the future,\" an Acpo spokeswoman said. \"Clearly if someone is breaking the speed limit outside a school when the children are coming out at 3.15pm, it's a no brainer and they would be punished. But if it is 3am and there's no-one on the streets, there is a degree of discretion.\" But Joel Hickman, spokesman for road safety charity Brake, said the new proposals \"sent out the wrong message\" and were \"simply a way of making money\" - a charge denied by Road Safety Minister Mike Penning. \"Many people drive for work and would rather pay Â£100 to go on a course than accumulate points and risk losing their licence, so it is quite clear which is the greater deterrent to speeding,\" said Mr Hickman. \"It sends out a message that it's ok to speed, which it certainly is not. Speeding causes tragedy every day on British roads and results in a huge number of people being killed and seriously injured. It's also a factor in a quarter of all crashes. \"If you hit a child at 30mph, it's the equivalent of that child falling out of a three storey building. Driving at 42mph would mean that child having no chance of survival.\" But Mr Penning insisted road safety is the government's \"top priority\". \"We support the targeted use of educational courses where these are shown to have a positive effect,\" he said. \"The police are responsible for the administration of these courses but we are clear that course fees should not be used to raise revenue.\" 'Get-out-of-jail-free card?' The Institute of Advanced Motorists said it supported \"the widening of the bandwidths that allow drivers to choose a speed awareness course over a fine\". \"We don't feel it gives a 'get-out-of-jail-free card' - drivers can only attend one speed\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nDrivers can pay to attend a speed awareness course instead of being fined for speeding, but critics say it is a money-making exercise.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "D", "ri", "vers", "▁can", "▁pay", "▁to", "▁attend", "▁a", "▁speed", "▁aw", "aren", "ess", "▁course", "▁instead", "▁of", "▁being", "▁f", "ined", "▁for", "▁speed", "ing", ",", "▁but", "▁critics", "▁say", "▁it", "▁is", "▁a", "▁money", "-", "making", "▁exercise", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁The", "▁", "2", "5", "-", "year", "-", "old", "▁man", ",", "▁who", "▁has", "▁not", "▁been", "▁named", ",", "▁was", "▁arrested", "▁on", "▁Monday", "▁and", "▁charged"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.025640465319156647, 0.0, 0.0, -0.00024077377747744322, -0.01260045263916254, -5.07818695041351e-05, -0.17301085591316223, -0.0012718691723421216, 0.0, 0.0, -4.768370445162873e-07, -3.576278118089249e-07, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.015384926460683346, 0.0, -7.152555099310121e-07, -0.0009177286992780864, -1.645074735279195e-05, -0.00010442188795423135, -0.3716343641281128, -0.25192904472351074, -3.576278118089249e-07, 0.0, -3.6954811548639555e-06, 0.0, -0.00010466027742950246, -0.00015853578224778175, -0.1730082482099533, -2.3841855067985307e-07, -0.6950181126594543, -1.0609570381348021e-05, -1.6689286894688848e-06, -4.541770613286644e-05, 0.0, 0.0, -0.0016989572905004025, -0.002988755237311125, -0.1378515064716339, -0.10776800662279129, -2.50339189733495e-06, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.4170165956020355, -0.4184584617614746, -0.015407347120344639, -0.0689239650964737, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.0005984899471513927, -0.009944537654519081, -4.577531944960356e-05, -0.3796168267726898, -0.05311610549688339, -0.1798330843448639], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": -1.6689286894688848e-06, "D": -0.025640465319156647, "ri": 0.0, "vers": 0.0, "▁can": -0.00024077377747744322, "▁pay": -0.01260045263916254, "▁to": -5.07818695041351e-05, "▁attend": -0.17301085591316223, "▁a": -3.576278118089249e-07, "▁speed": -0.015384926460683346, "▁aw": 0.0, "aren": -4.768370445162873e-07, "ess": -3.576278118089249e-07, "▁course": 0.0, "▁instead": 0.0, "▁of": 0.0, "▁being": 0.0, "▁f": 0.0, "ined": 0.0, "▁for": 0.0, "ing": 0.0, ",": 0.0, "▁but": -0.0009177286992780864, "▁critics": -1.645074735279195e-05, "▁say": -0.00010442188795423135, "▁it": -0.3716343641281128, "▁is": -0.25192904472351074, "▁money": 0.0, "-": 0.0, "making": 0.0, "▁exercise": -0.00010466027742950246, ".": -0.00015853578224778175, "##": -0.6950181126594543, "#": -1.0609570381348021e-05, "Art": -4.541770613286644e-05, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "▁The": -0.0016989572905004025, "▁": -0.002988755237311125, "2": -0.1378515064716339, "5": -0.10776800662279129, "year": 0.0, "old": 0.0, "▁man": -0.4170165956020355, "▁who": -0.015407347120344639, "▁has": -0.0689239650964737, "▁not": 0.0, "▁been": 0.0, "▁named": 0.0, "▁was": -0.0005984899471513927, "▁arrested": -0.009944537654519081, "▁on": -4.577531944960356e-05, "▁Monday": -0.3796168267726898, "▁and": -0.05311610549688339, "▁charged": -0.1798330843448639}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

She said that Sophia was wearing just a nappy and T-shirt when she wandered off. \"The only thing I was thinking was well, hopefully the dog would have kept her warm,\" Ms Cook was quoted as saying. \"If [the dog] wasn't with her, I don't know whether they would have found her.\" The family issued a statement thanking emergency services and promising that Poppy would be \"well fed this evening\".\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\nA pet dog is being credited with keeping a little girl safe after the pair wandered away from their family home and could not be found for hours.\n\n###\nArticle: The 26-year-old midfielder has signed \"an initial one-year deal\", with Ray McKinnon expressing delight at his first signing as manager at Tannadice. \"He is exactly the type of player we need going into this season,\" he said. \"Not only is he the right age and a good footballer, but he is a ball winner who is strong in the tackle and will protect our central defenders.\" Murdoch had joined County last summer after his departure from Fleetwood Town. But half of his 34 appearances came as a substitute and he followed fellow midfielder Rocco Quinn out of the Scottish Premiership club. Murdoch, who began his career with Falkirk and had a loan spell with Northampton Town before joining Fleetwood in 2013, told United's website: \"I'm delighted to be joining Dundee United - it was an easy decision to make. \"It's a massive club and I want to help them get back to the Premiership, where they should be.\" Following United's relegation from the top flight, 13 players have exited Tannadice along with manager Mixu Paatelainen and his backroom staff. While Murdoch and Quinn have exited County, manager Jim McIntyre has already recruited three defenders and a goalkeeper, Aaron McCarey from Wolves, this summer. Christopher Routis has arrived from Bradford City, Kenny van der Weg from Breda and Erik Cikos from Slovan Bratislava.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nDundee United have signed midfielder Murdoch from County on an initial one-year deal.</s", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "D", "und", "ee", "▁United", "▁have", "▁signed", "▁mid", "f", "iel", "der", "▁Mur", "do", "ch", "▁from", "▁County", "▁on", "▁an", "▁initial", "▁one", "-", "year", "▁deal", ".", "</s>"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.000248401309363544, -3.576278118089249e-07, 0.0, -2.0265558760002023e-06, -0.11761453747749329, -0.0008404298569075763, -2.539125671319198e-05, 0.0, 0.0, -2.3841855067985307e-07, -0.018372710794210434, 0.0, 0.0, -0.07932723313570023, -0.00021371940965764225, -1.9073468138230965e-06, -0.6931644678115845, -3.576278118089249e-07, -9.65590606938349e-06, -1.1920928244535389e-07, 0.0, -0.005818454083055258, -0.3023547828197479, -0.6936637163162231], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "D": -0.000248401309363544, "und": -3.576278118089249e-07, "ee": 0.0, "▁United": -2.0265558760002023e-06, "▁have": -0.11761453747749329, "▁signed": -0.0008404298569075763, "▁mid": -2.539125671319198e-05, "f": 0.0, "iel": 0.0, "der": -2.3841855067985307e-07, "▁Mur": -0.018372710794210434, "do": 0.0, "ch": 0.0, "▁from": -0.07932723313570023, "▁County": -0.00021371940965764225, "▁on": -1.9073468138230965e-06, "▁an": -0.6931644678115845, "▁initial": -3.576278118089249e-07, "▁one": -9.65590606938349e-06, "-": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "year": 0.0, "▁deal": -0.005818454083055258, ".": -0.3023547828197479, "</s>": -0.6936637163162231}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

Uber has been under fire over its treatment of women staff since a former employee wrote a scathing blog post about her experience. It led to two investigations and the uncovering of 215 complaints about harassment and other allegations. Uber has struggled with a series of controversies in recent months, including a backlash over aggressive corporate tactics and a lawsuit from Google-owner Alphabet over allegedly stolen technology for self-driving cars. Several high-placed executives resigned amid the turbulence, including a former head of engineering, who had failed to disclose harassment complaints at his former employer. Chief executive Travis Kalanick's filmed argument with an Uber driver over falling rates also fuelled criticism, leading him to say that he needed \"leadership help\". Susan Fowler, who wrote the critical blog post about Uber, said the company had ignored her complaints of sexual harassment. Widely shared, the blog prompted Mr Kalanick to launch the investigations. Does Silicon Valley have a sexism problem? Uber's mess reaches beyond sexism - and Silicon Valley Law firm Perkins Coie reviewed 215 claims, which included sexual harassment and discrimination as well as other complaints, an Uber spokeswoman said. The firm recommended no action in 100 of them; 57 remain under review, while others have received warnings or are in training, she said. Some of those fired held senior positions, she said. Discrimination, 54; Sexual harassment, 47; Unprofessional behaviour, 45; Bullying, 33; Other harassment, 19; Retaliation, 13; Physical security 3; Wrongful dismissal 1. Staff fired, 20; Staff put in training, 31; Final warnings, 7; Claims still under review, 57. Uber has also appointed Eric Holder, who served as attorney general under former US president Barack Obama, to investigate the company's broader culture. The findings of that report have been turned over to the board and recommendations are expected to be made public next week. Some changes are already in place. Uber announced the hiring of two women to high profile positions this week. Frances Frei, a Harvard Business School professor, will serve as a senior vice president for leadership and strategy, working with the head of human resources Liane Hornsey. Ms Hornsey is herself relatively new, starting at the company in January. Bozoma Saint John, a former marketing executive at Apple, is also joining Uber as chief brand officer. Uber employs more than 12,000 people globally. About 36% of the workforce is female, according to a diversity report the firm published earlier this year. Women hold about 15% of the technology positions. It goes without saying that this issue doesn't go away with these firings. Uber has major questions still to answer - some of them will hopefully be addressed when more details of the report are made public. Most troubling is why Uber's own internal HR measures weren't thorough or fair enough to see that the actions of 20 employees warranted dismissal. Instead it took a brave former employee - and then an expensive, lengthy investigation - to get to that point.

Five competitions between them, five golds won. As of Tuesday night, had the couple been a country they would have sat 13th on the medal table, above Jamaica, Kenya and Brazil. That would be to misunderstand what makes them tick. This is a couple who got engaged while on the sofa watching an episode of EastEnders. You might think too that it would get competitive around the breakfast table in the cottage they share just outside Knutsford in Cheshire. Kenny now has six Olympic golds from three Games, more than Sir Steve Redgrave and Sir Bradley Wiggins. Trott has four, more than any other British woman, and from one fewer Olympics. That would be to misjudge their relationship. Cycling superstars on their own, together they can be almost ordinary, almost invisible. After the gold rush, after their tearful embrace in the Rio velodrome with the world watching on, that may be about to change. \"The difference in their characters is what makes it work for them,\" says Trott's father Adrian. \"Until he gets to know you, Jason is a little bit shy. He's quiet and understated. Laura is bubbly, chatty, just as you see in her interviews. \"If they were both like Jason, God only knows how they'd talk about anything. And God forbid having two Lauras in a household!\" The relationship between the two began in the build-up to London 2012, with Kenny about to come out of Chris Hoy's muscled shadow at his second Olympics and Trott about to experience her first. \"I remember seeing Laura at the velodrome years ago,\" says Kenny's mother Lorraine. \"I said to my husband, 'Flipping heck, you need to watch this young lady.' She was in the elimination race, only a tiny thing, and she kept sprinting over the top of everyone. She was amazing. \"The first time I knew something was happening between the two of them was when Jason phoned me up and said, 'I'm bringing Trotty home for a bacon butty.' \"I said to him, 'Is she your girlfriend?' 'No, she's just a friend.' \"She made herself at home straight away. Into the house, sat down, feet up on the sofa. \"We liked her from the off. She's a girly girl, so I can talk make-up and clothes to her. It's such a treat - having had two sons, I've had years of remote-control cars and standing out in the rain, and at last I can talk to someone about posh shoes.\" Trott and Kenny are not the first couple to both win Olympic golds. Some (Steffi Graf, ladies' singles 1988, Andre Agassi, men's singles 1996) have carried more global renown. Others have also won gold in the same sport at the same Games, most recently triathletes Jan Frodeno and Emma Snowsill at Beijing in 2008. But no-one at a summer Games has more. No-one else gets even close. Neither has the British duo finished. Trott is 24, Kenny 28.

The country had a lone shining moment with Girisha Hosanagara Nagarajegowda's silver medal in Men's High Jump F42 class for athletes with an impairment that affects their arms or legs. And deservedly the nation cherished Girisha's feat as medals have generally eluded India's Paralympians. But now questions are being raised at the country's ability to translate the congratulatory tone into awareness of disabled rights. India is not known for being friendly towards the disabled and most public places still lack basic facilities to help them in everyday life.ã€€ 'Second-class' citizens Even before Girisha won his medal, Indian media was abuzz with stories about problems at the Athletes' Village. Several athletes complained that the Paralympics Committee of India had failed to book accommodation for escorts and coaches at the facility. This made the lives of the athletes very tough as they were denied precious time with their coaches. Taking to CNN-IBN, weightlifter Farman Basha said his preparation was severely affected because he could not move freely in the village without his escort. \"I was confident of a medal and now all my training has gone in vain,\" he said. The channel's editor, Rajdeep Sardesai, ran a special show to discuss whether India treats its Paralympians as second-class citizens. Many other channels and newspapers followed suit. It's an irony that the controversy received more coverage than the Games themselves. India may have won just one medal, but the Games were full of inspiring stories. The media seems to have clearly missed a chance to tell these stories to Indians in detail.ã€€ Speaking on the CNN-IBN show, Olympic silver medallist Rajyawardhan Singh Rathod said he was not surprised with the treatment of India's Paralympians. He said much needs to be changed to give equal rights to Paralympians and millions of disabled people in India. \"It's an over-all attitude shift that we need to bring about in our country,\" he said. There is another thread to the story that the India media seems to have missed. The Indian contingent at the Paralympics did not have a single female athlete. While officials say this boils down to qualification woes, the problem runs much deeper. Most schools and colleges lack basic sporting facilities for the disabled and the ones which do rarely encourage disabled women to participate.ã€€ While stories about the controversy continue to make headlines, nobody can take anything away from Girisha. The athlete certainly fought against the odds to make sure India did not return home from London empty handed. He hails from the south Indian state of Karnataka and belongs to an average middle class family. But his determination to win a medal set him apart from others. His training in Bangalore took place away from the glare of the media and fan recognition. With support from an NGO and government, Girisha quit his bank job six months ago to concentrate on training. Today the result is there for everyone to see. And he hopes that his achievement will transcend the boundaries of sporting achievement\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nThe silver medal won by Girisha H.

In one, the prime minister apologises to all homosexuals living in Uganda and gives his support to a gay pride march. Homosexual acts are illegal in Uganda and gay people have faced physical attacks and social rejection. Earlier this year, a controversial anti-gay bill, which proposes to increase the penalties for homosexual acts from 14 years in jail to life, was re-tabled in the Ugandan parliament. The bill was first introduced in 2009 but never debated - and the MP backing the legislation says a clause proposing the death penalty will be dropped. It originally said those found guilty of \"aggravated homosexuality\" - defined as when one of the participants is a minor, HIV-positive, disabled or a \"serial offender\" - would face the death penalty. The Uganda Justice Law and Order Sector website was also reportedly taken over by hackers this week. Ambrose Ruyooka, commissioner for the Information Communications Technology ministry, told the BBC the problem had now been rectified. The government has created a directorate of security for all government websites and tightened cyber laws to counter rising cyber crime, he said. An activist named @DramaSett3r on Twitter is said to be behind the attacks. The operations were carried out by a group known as The Elite Society and the Anonymous hacktivist community, the activist said. On Wednesday, the official website of Prime Minister Amama Mbabazi quoted him as saying: \"We have got to expel the narrow mindedness from this country, and begin afresh, starting with a full and formal apology to all homosexuals living in Uganda today,\" screen grabs on Twitter and Facebook show. A message allegedly posted by the hackers on the prime minister's site on Tuesday said: \"Your violations of the rights of LGBT [lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender] people have disgusted us. \"All people have the right to live in dignity free from the repression of someone else's political and religious beliefs.\" The East African nation is a largely conservative society and many people condemn homosexuality both as unAfrican and unChristian. Western donors have recently said they could withdraw aid from those countries, including many in Africa, which do not recognise gay rights.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nHackers have taken over the website of Uganda's Prime Minister and posted messages of support for gay rights and apologies for the persecution of homosexuals.</s", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "H", "ack", "ers", "▁have", "▁taken", "▁over", "▁the", "▁website", "▁of", "▁U", "g", "anda", "'", "s", "▁Prime", "▁Minister", "▁and", "▁posted", "▁messages", "▁of", "▁support", "▁for", "▁gay", "▁rights", "▁and", "▁ap", "ologies", "▁for", "▁the", "▁per", "sec", "ution", "▁of", "▁hom", "osex", "uals", ".", "</s>"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.01509047020226717, 0.0, 0.0, -0.043029144406318665, -4.768370445162873e-07, -0.02406482771039009, -0.00020883286197204143, -0.3610536456108093, 0.0, -0.05270036309957504, 0.0, -0.00036459474358707666, 0.0, 0.0, -0.3608853220939636, -3.576278118089249e-07, -0.09634256362915039, -5.960462772236497e-07, -7.748573807475623e-06, -0.19290001690387726, 0.0, -1.311301275563892e-06, -0.00056429672986269, -0.007294331677258015, -0.688123345375061, -0.0029717590659856796, -0.010168887674808502, -7.152555099310121e-07, -0.017671050503849983, -0.25235962867736816, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.00024041623692028224, 0.0, -3.6954811548639555e-06, -0.015416385605931282, -0.3608942925930023], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "H": -0.01509047020226717, "ack": 0.0, "ers": 0.0, "▁have": -0.043029144406318665, "▁taken": -4.768370445162873e-07, "▁over": -0.02406482771039009, "▁the": -0.017671050503849983, "▁website": -0.3610536456108093, "▁of": 0.0, "▁U": -0.05270036309957504, "g": 0.0, "anda": -0.00036459474358707666, "'": 0.0, "s": 0.0, "▁Prime": -0.3608853220939636, "▁Minister": -3.576278118089249e-07, "▁and": -0.688123345375061, "▁posted": -5.960462772236497e-07, "▁messages": -7.748573807475623e-06, "▁support": 0.0, "▁for": -7.152555099310121e-07, "▁gay": -0.00056429672986269, "▁rights": -0.007294331677258015, "▁ap": -0.0029717590659856796, "ologies": -0.010168887674808502, "▁per": -0.25235962867736816, "sec": 0.0, "ution": 0.0, "▁hom": -0.00024041623692028224, "osex": 0.0, "uals": -3.6954811548639555e-06, ".": -0.015416385605931282, "</s>": -0.3608942925930023}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

The researchers studied a group of hazel dormice in Denbighshire as part of the project. It found some dormice breed before they are one year old. The research also established that some produce two litters in a year, which was known behaviour in continental European mice but had never been observed in the UK before. The study is the longest and largest of its kind in the UK. Chester Zoo's biodiversity officer Sarah Bird said: \"Promiscuity in females had never been recorded before; and it will increase genetic diversity within litters, helping population survival. \"Equally important are the other breeding behaviours we have seen. \"It is likely that those years when females breed twice, and the young of the year also breed, is when populations can really increase. \"These behaviours are likely to be critical for healthy sustainable dormouse populations in the UK.\" Hazel dormice are protected under European law. The numbers of dormice and the range of the species have both been in decline since recording of the animals and their habitat began in 1990. However the Denbighshire site at Bontuchel, near Ruthin, showed a large, stable population of dormice. \"Our survey site in north Wales is on the very north western edge of their European range and, from the very start, we've been surprised by how many hazel dormice are there,\" Ms Bird explained. \"That's why it's a very important project and a very important site for study, to understand why this woodland is so good for dormice.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nResearchers have discovered that some Hazel dormice in the UK are breeding before the age of one and having two litters a year, a behaviour never seen before.</s", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "Res", "earch", "ers", "▁have", "▁discovered", "▁that", "▁some", "▁Haz", "el", "▁d", "orm", "ice", "▁in", "▁the", "▁UK", "▁are", "▁bre", "eding", "▁before", "▁the", "▁age", "▁of", "▁one", "▁and", "▁having", "▁two", "▁lit", "ters", "▁a", "▁year", ",", "▁a", "▁behaviour", "▁never", "▁seen", "▁before", ".", "</s>"], "token_logprobs": [-1.1920928244535389e-07, -0.01493158284574747, 0.0, -0.002157504903152585, -0.8904951810836792, -0.5121312141418457, -0.0037741875275969505, -0.0366249680519104, -0.6950098872184753, 0.0, -0.25192904472351074, 0.0, -3.862306402879767e-05, -3.4570634852570947e-06, -0.0177683737128973, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -0.004982554819434881, -1.4305104514278355e-06, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -0.09098831564188004, -0.12139305472373962, -1.1920928244535389e-07, 0.0, -3.576278118089249e-07, -0.17337988317012787, -0.1733190417289734, -5.960462772236497e-07, 0.0, 0.0, -0.05425255373120308, 0.0, -0.008872962556779385, -0.12323734909296036, -0.03587562218308449, -0.17387692630290985, -0.11737870424985886, -1.6689286894688848e-06, -0.11809727549552917, -0.07893171906471252], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "Res": -0.01493158284574747, "earch": 0.0, "ers": -0.002157504903152585, "▁have": -0.8904951810836792, "▁discovered": -0.5121312141418457, "▁that": -0.0037741875275969505, "▁some": -0.0366249680519104, "▁Haz": -0.6950098872184753, "el": 0.0, "▁d": -0.25192904472351074, "orm": 0.0, "ice": -3.862306402879767e-05, "▁in": -3.4570634852570947e-06, "▁the": -0.12139305472373962, "▁UK": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "▁are": -0.004982554819434881, "▁bre": -1.4305104514278355e-06, "eding": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "▁before": -1.6689286894688848e-06, "▁age": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "▁of": 0.0, "▁one": -3.576278118089249e-07, "▁and": -0.17337988317012787, "▁having": -0.1733190417289734, "▁two": -5.960462772236497e-07, "▁lit": 0.0, "ters": 0.0, "▁a": -0.12323734909296036, "▁year": 0.0, ",": -0.008872962556779385, "▁behaviour": -0.03587562218308449, "▁never": -0.17387692630290985, "▁seen": -0.11737870424985886, ".": -0.11809727549552917, "</s>": -0.07893171906471252}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

At the party's weekly press briefing, I asked the Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies, who was elected on the list, whether he'd stand as a constituency candidate in his home turf of the Vale of Glamorgan but he said he hadn't thought about it. Presumably those are the kind of decisions they will now feel more confident contemplating. The party will also have a huge amount of new data on voters which it'll be able to call upon and the belief that campaigning hard on the NHS helped the Tories cross the line in places like the Vale of Clwyd and Gower. The Conservatives feel it's them, rather than any of the other opposition parties, who have become the repository of votes from those who are disaffected by the state of the NHS. Welsh Labour are going to hold a \"short sharp\" analysis into what went wrong. Carwyn Jones was in line with most of the criticism of Ed Miliband when he told AMs that the party needed to appeal to small business owners who are not millionaires but who work hard. What will be more difficult is countering the argument on the NHS, which the former minister Alun Davies believes is already lost. Another potential difficulty for Welsh Labour will be dealing with unhappiness within the party over council re-organisation. Bernie Attridge, the deputy leader of Flintshire Council, has tweeted saying the party needs to be careful on local government reform if it wants to retain the support of grassroots councillors. It also seems to have been the case that Labour lost more votes to UKIP than the Conservatives, which is another challenge to overcome. But Labour will at least have the advantage that it will be David Cameron, and not Ed Miliband, carrying out the latest round of public sector cuts that are likely to take effect sooner rather than later. The question is whether Carwyn Jones is going to be able to turn that to his advantage when his own record in government will be under scrutiny. Plaid Cymru's education spokesman, Simon Thomas, also in the party's weekly press briefing, said he believed Leanne Wood could portray herself as an alternative first minister because of the way she emotionally connected with people in the campaign. The party now has a year to make that a credible proposition after it failed to gain any new seats and came fourth, behind UKIP, in the overall share of the vote, despite her unprecedented profile. He also said that on the campaign trail people wanted to know what Plaid was going to do about the NHS and that people \"did not see the strengths\" of its arguments. The Welsh Liberal Democrats are still licking their wounds but in a \"je ne regrette rien\" moment, the leader Kirsty Williams said she had no regrets over the coalition.

The bill would allow Japan to defend its allies overseas even when it is not under attack. The bill is not widely supported by the country at large. Thousands of protesters rallied outside the parliament in Tokyo as the committee debate was under way. Opposition lawmakers tried to physically prevent the debate from taking place.

The opposition had also tabled a no-confidence vote against Mr Konoike. Wednesday night's session was abandoned in the early hours of Thursday after opposition lawmakers blocked entry to a room where Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and other ministers were waiting to discuss the bill. The bill has already been approved by the government-dominated lower house. It is expected to be passed in the upper house because the ruling coalition has a majority there - this was why opponents were keen to prevent the committee from approving the legislation. It is thought Mr Abe's government wants to pass the bills before the country goes into a five-day holiday on Saturday, which could provide an opportunity for even bigger protests. If the upper house does not pass the bills within 60 days, they will have to be returned the lower house. It is a step Mr Abe is thought to be willing to take. His Liberal Democratic Party-led bloc has a two-thirds majority in the lower chamber, the House of Representatives. Despite his majorities in both houses, the controversial bills, and Mr Abe's determination to push them through despite vocal opposition, appear to have damaged his popularity. Polls have consistently shown a majority of the public are opposed to the changes, and relatively few strongly support them. Japan's post-World War Two constitution bars it from using force to resolve conflicts except in cases of self-defence. Mr Abe's government has pushed for security legislation that would allow Japan's military to mobilise overseas when these three conditions are met: What's behind Japan's military shift? The government says Japan needs to pass the bills, which are welcomed by the US, to ensure regional peace and security in the face of rising Chinese assertiveness. It also says they will allow the country to participate more widely in global peacekeeping missions. But opponents say the legislation violates Japan's post-war pacifist constitution, and could lead to it being dragged into US-led conflicts. Despite the likelihood of eventual defeat, opposition to the bills has been credited with helping reverse decades of youth disengagement from politics in Japan. Students in particular, have been closely involved in leading protests once dominated by trade unionists\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nOpposition lawmakers in the Japanese parliament have been credited with helping to pass the bills, which are welcomed by the US, to ensure regional peace and security in the face of rising Chinese assertiveness.

It comes after Theresa May suggested Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn had not done enough to condemn abuse. The PM has called for parties to unite against \"bullying and harassment\". Since last month's general election, attention has focused on abuse suffered by MPs from across the political spectrum, including Tory Sheryll Murray who said she had faced social media comments like \"burn the witch\". On Saturday, Labour MP Yvette Cooper said some of her party's supporters had targeted female Conservative MPs - as well as Labour members - with \"vitriolic abuse\". But ahead of the Parliamentary debate, Labour has levelled accusations against the Tories in a letter to Conservative Party chairman Sir Patrick McLoughlin from his Labour counterpart Ian Lavery and Cat Smith, shadow minister for voter engagement. \"Parties and politicians have a responsibility to set an example, by treating others with dignity and respect, including those with whom we strongly disagree,\" they wrote. \"The Conservative Party has instead promoted personal attacks as a core component of its national campaign. \"Abuse against candidates on social media is completely unacceptable. The Conservative Party perpetrated this on an industrial scale by spending millions of pounds to post highly personalised and nasty attack adverts on voters' Facebook timelines without their permission.\" They claimed Labour \"fought a positive, hopeful campaign\" and insisted that all its MPs ran campaigns based on its policies rather than personal attacks. On Monday, Mrs May - asked whether Mr Corbyn was doing enough in response to complaints of intimidation - said she was \"surprised at any party leader who's not willing to condemn that\". Conservative Simon Hart has secured Wednesday afternoon's Westminster Hall debate on \"the abuse and intimidation of candidates and the public in UK elections\". Speaking on the BBC's Daily Politics on Tuesday, Mr Hart said there had been a clear change in attitudes towards MPs and campaigners between the 2015 and 2017 general elections. People wanting to publicly support candidates were being \"driven away from politics at a time when we need them\" he said. \"This extends way beyond the so-called bullying of MPs, this is about online bullying generally,\" he said, claiming there had been a \"deafening silence\" from political leaders. Mr Hart claimed the emergence of Jeremy Corbyn-backing grassroots organisation Momentum had played a \"significant part\" in this shift. But Momentum dismissed his accusation as \"baseless\". \"If we are going to tackle the abuse MPs from across the political spectrum face, Simon Hart and other Conservative MPs should stop making baseless accusations for which they offer no proof, and instead think about how we can work together to find a solution,\" a spokesman for the group said.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nLabour MPs have been accused of running a \"negative, nasty campaign\" of targeting female MPs, as a Westminster debate on the issue of bullying and harassment of MPs is set to take place.\n\n\n\n</s", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "Lab", "our", "▁MP", "s", "▁have", "▁been", "▁accused", "▁of", "▁running", "▁a", "▁\"", "negative", ",", "▁nast", "y", "▁campaign", "\"", "▁of", "▁target", "ing", "▁female", "▁MP", "s", ",", "▁as", "▁a", "▁West", "min", "ster", "▁debate", "▁on", "▁the", "▁issue", "▁of", "▁bul", "lying", "▁and", "▁har", "ass", "ment", "▁of", "▁MP", "s", "▁is", "▁set", "▁to", "▁take", "▁place", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "</s>"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.08262653648853302, 0.0, -0.03532400727272034, -7.629365427419543e-06, -0.11747293919324875, -0.6996060013771057, -0.05626920238137245, -5.602820692729438e-06, -1.7404405298293568e-05, -6.4490144723095e-05, -0.25195443630218506, -0.13420608639717102, -0.019264737144112587, 0.0, -1.0728830375228426e-06, -0.0019375376868993044, -0.00030071981018409133, -0.25359129905700684, -0.31653881072998047, -0.0001538873475510627, -0.02892352268099785, -0.00159708212595433, 0.0, -0.3729988932609558, -0.5454824566841125, -0.6326456665992737, -0.09632156044244766, -2.3841855067985307e-07, 0.0, -3.3378546504536644e-06, -0.5239650011062622, -0.41858866810798645, -0.5066986680030823, -0.09312042593955994, -0.27009835839271545, 0.0, -0.2121351957321167, -0.0010583758121356368, -1.0728830375228426e-06, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -0.543267548084259, -0.20931121706962585, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -0.0007402540650218725, -0.05355517938733101, 0.0, -1.0728830375228426e-06, 0.0, -9.536738616588991e-07, -0.2520807087421417, -2.3841855067985307e-07, -0.005535156466066837, -1.847726889536716e-05, -0.6939588785171509], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": -1.847726889536716e-05, "Lab": -0.08262653648853302, "our": 0.0, "▁MP": -0.20931121706962585, "s": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "▁have": -0.11747293919324875, "▁been": -0.6996060013771057, "▁accused": -0.05626920238137245, "▁of": -0.543267548084259, "▁running": -1.7404405298293568e-05, "▁a": -0.6326456665992737, "▁\"": -0.25195443630218506, "negative": -0.13420608639717102, ",": -0.3729988932609558, "▁nast": 0.0, "y": -1.0728830375228426e-06, "▁campaign": -0.0019375376868993044, "\"": -0.00030071981018409133, "▁target": -0.31653881072998047, "ing": -0.0001538873475510627, "▁female": -0.02892352268099785, "▁as": -0.5454824566841125, "▁West": -0.09632156044244766, "min": -2.3841855067985307e-07, "ster": 0.0, "▁debate": -3.3378546504536644e-06, "▁on": -0.5239650011062622, "▁the": -0.41858866810798645, "▁issue": -0.5066986680030823, "▁bul": -0.27009835839271545, "lying": 0.0, "▁and": -0.2121351957321167, "▁har": -0.0010583758121356368, "ass": -1.0728830375228426e-06, "ment": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "▁is": -0.0007402540650218725, "▁set": -0.05355517938733101, "▁to": 0.0, "▁take": -1.0728830375228426e-06, "▁place": 0.0, ".": -9.536738616588991e-07, "</s>": -0.6939588785171509}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

It was part of an event where 250 schoolchildren were introduced to music in front of the Duke and Duchess. The Royal party are due back in the UK on Friday evening, after a five-day tour that began in Poland on Monday. On the last day of the tour, the Duchess, who comes from a musical family and played the flute at school, took the musicians through the first notes of Beethoven's fifth symphony. The royal couple then listened to a performance of a symphony especially adapted for young people, and then went on stage to learn more about the orchestra. Earlier, Catherine and William walked around the stage accompanying six children trying out different instruments, including a violin, flute, timpani [kettle drums] and trombone. Later the Duke of Cambridge gave Prince George and Princess Charlotte a guided tour of a helicopter at the Airbus factory in Hamburg. Prince George tried on a pilot's helmet while Princess Charlotte played with buttons in the cockpit. The Duke flew helicopters when he was an air ambulance pilot. Antoine van Gent, head of flight testing at Airbus, said: \"The Duke was very relaxed showing his children the professional aircraft he uses. \"George was excited, with the first helicopter he wanted to sit in the cockpit and then he wanted to sit in the next one, he already knew there was a difference between them.\" Charlotte was less impressed after taking a tumble on the concrete after leaving the aircraft but Mr van Gent said she enjoyed playing in the pilot's seat.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nThe Duchess of Cambridge took part in a symphony with schoolchildren in Hamburg, while her husband Prince William took their two young children to see a helicopter at Airbus.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "The", "▁Duch", "ess", "▁of", "▁Cambridge", "▁took", "▁part", "▁in", "▁a", "▁sym", "phony", "▁with", "▁school", "children", "▁in", "▁Hamburg", ",", "▁while", "▁her", "▁husband", "▁Prince", "▁William", "▁took", "▁their", "▁two", "▁young", "▁children", "▁to", "▁see", "▁a", "▁hel", "ic", "opter", "▁at", "▁Air", "bus", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁The", "▁", "2", "5", "-", "year", "-", "old", "▁man", "▁was", "▁arrested", "▁on", "▁", "2", "1", "▁December", "▁and", "▁appeared"], "token_logprobs": [-1.311301275563892e-06, -0.004461335483938456, -0.5063608288764954, 0.0, 0.0, -0.0029270683880895376, -0.5180866122245789, -0.43327558040618896, 0.0, -0.2521059215068817, -0.2945738434791565, -1.2993727978027891e-05, -0.001906840712763369, -0.008338754065334797, -0.028553785756230354, -0.10611483454704285, -6.913899414939806e-05, -0.46786999702453613, -0.0002592465898487717, -0.0005729940603487194, -7.152555099310121e-07, -0.0037902200128883123, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -0.7198807597160339, -0.0006940339808352292, -0.17300856113433838, -0.014872037805616856, 0.0, -0.5063609480857849, -0.00394079415127635, -0.0029295645654201508, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.00024184639914892614, -0.029809430241584778, 0.0, -0.0008953376673161983, -0.42937371134757996, -6.961580220377073e-05, -0.0291273295879364, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -3.683499380713329e-05, -0.052729200571775436, -3.576278118089249e-07, -1.4305104514278355e-06, -0.016316093504428864, -0.01387839112430811, -0.5627081990242004, -0.9074956178665161, -2.264974000354414e-06, 0.0, -1.0728830375228426e-06, 0.0, -0.3252573609352112, -0.8056185841560364, -0.335046648979187, -0.07651714980602264, -0.8505052924156189, -0.7001626491546631, -1.491727590560913, -0.5441889762878418, -0.642591118812561, -0.06606458872556686], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": -3.683499380713329e-05, "The": -0.004461335483938456, "▁Duch": -0.5063608288764954, "ess": 0.0, "▁of": 0.0, "▁Cambridge": -0.0029270683880895376, "▁took": -0.7198807597160339, "▁part": -0.43327558040618896, "▁in": -0.10611483454704285, "▁a": -0.0029295645654201508, "▁sym": -0.2945738434791565, "phony": -1.2993727978027891e-05, "▁with": -0.001906840712763369, "▁school": -0.008338754065334797, "children": -0.028553785756230354, "▁Hamburg": -6.913899414939806e-05, ",": -0.46786999702453613, "▁while": -0.0002592465898487717, "▁her": -0.0005729940603487194, "▁husband": -7.152555099310121e-07, "▁Prince": -0.0037902200128883123, "▁William": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "▁their": -0.0006940339808352292, "▁two": -0.17300856113433838, "▁young": -0.014872037805616856, "▁children": 0.0, "▁to": -0.5063609480857849, "▁see": -0.00394079415127635, "▁hel": 0.0, "ic": 0.0, "opter": 0.0, "▁at": -0.00024184639914892614, "▁Air": -0.029809430241584778, "bus": 0.0, ".": -0.0008953376673161983, "##": -0.0291273295879364, "#": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "Art": -0.052729200571775436, "icle": -3.576278118089249e-07, ":": -1.4305104514278355e-06, "▁The": -0.016316093504428864, "▁": -0.8505052924156189, "2": -0.7001626491546631, "5": -0.9074956178665161, "-": -1.0728830375228426e-06, "year": 0.0, "old": 0.0, "▁man": -0.3252573609352112, "▁was": -0.8056185841560364, "▁arrested": -0.335046648979187, "▁on": -0.07651714980602264, "1": -1.491727590560913, "▁December": -0.5441889762878418, "▁and": -0.642591118812561, "▁appeared": -0.06606458872556686}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

Non-compliance with the pricing guidelines may have led to the termination of contracts, it found. Apple has not yet responded to a request for comment. At the time of the investigation, Apple denied that it controlled its products' pricing, telling Reuters that resellers \"set their own prices for the Apple products they sell in Russia and around the world\". The regulator said Apple had now ended its price-fixing practices but has not said whether the company faces a fine. The FAS claimed that Apple Rus monitored the retail prices for the iPhone 5c, 5s, 6, 6 Plus, 6s and 6s Plus. \"In the case of the establishment of 'inappropriate' prices, the Russian subsidiary of Apple sent emails to resellers asking them to change,\" the watchdog said. The deputy head of the FAS, Andrey Tsarikovsky, added that \"Apple actively co-operated\" with the investigation and that the company had \"adopted the necessary measures to eliminate violations of the law\". That included training employees in the \"anti-monopoly legislation norms\" in Russia. In May, the FAS found that Google used its dominant position to force its own apps and services on users and fined it Â£5m ($6m).

It was eventually handed to Donald Mackechnie, 66, at his home in Glasgow. The Bible had originally belonged to the great-grandfather of Mr Mackechnie's grandmother. Mr Whitehead, who was gifted the pocket-sized book in 2001 by an amateur Bible collector from Cleveland, Ohio, had rediscovered it when moving home in May. Noting that the Bible bore the name Alexander MacDonald of Inverness with the date 1 January, 1866, he decided to track down the descendants of Mr MacDonald, who was born in 1825 and worked as a ship master, wine merchant and grocer. After contacting Highland Council, he was put in touch with Anne Fraser, a historian at the Highland Archive Centre who created a MacDonald family tree. Mr Whitehead then used social media to track down Mr Mackechnie's daughter Mairi in Glasgow, who alerted her Islay-raised father. The Bible, which had a four-leaf clover tucked within its pages, was hand-delivered to Mr Mackechnie by Alistair Begg, a pastor at Mr Whitehead's church in Ohio who is originally from Glasgow and was visiting relatives in the city last month. Mr Mackechnie, clerk to the board at St Columba Gaelic Church of Scotland in Glasgow, said: \"There was a knock on the door one day and this chap was standing there. \"I almost fell on the floor when he explained what he was giving me. I could not believe it, it was such a shock and a surprise. \"The whole family are delighted and over the moon to receive his previously unheard of family heirloom. \"It does not even enter your head that this kind of thing could ever happen - it is quite amazing.\" Mr Mackechnie, a retired mechanical design draftsman, said the story of the Bible's return to Scotland is \"fascinating and shows there are still kind people in the world\". Mr Whitehead, who chose the book from a collection of more than 100, said he believes it is not a coincidence that it has been returned to the family of the original owner. \"I am very pleased that this keepsake treasure of the MacDonald family, located in Cleveland, Ohio, was safely returned to Mr MacDonald's native homeland,\" he said. \"It would not have happened if it had not been for the tireless effort of Anne Fraser and the kind gracious act of my senior pastor, Alistair Begg.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nThe Bible, which was lost in the USA, has been returned to the family of the original owner in Scotland.\n\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "The", "▁Bible", ",", "▁which", "▁was", "▁lost", "▁in", "▁the", "▁USA", ",", "▁has", "▁been", "▁returned", "▁to", "▁the", "▁family", "▁of", "▁the", "▁original", "▁owner", "▁in", "▁Scotland", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁The", "▁", "1", "9", "6", "1", "▁film", ",", "▁directed", "▁by", "▁Stanley", "▁Kub", "rick", ",", "▁was", "▁released", "▁on", "▁", "1", "7", "▁April", "▁", "1", "9", "6", "1", ".", "▁The", "▁film", "▁was", "▁released"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.14805704355239868, -0.5134298205375671, -0.45506787300109863, -0.024606870487332344, -0.002974968170747161, -1.0421019792556763, -0.1175205260515213, -0.9723649024963379, -0.720262885093689, -0.03822237253189087, -0.023247426375746727, -0.00010477947944309562, -0.001984414178878069, -1.1444026313256472e-05, -0.18157556653022766, -0.0007457336178049445, -0.0008571050129830837, -0.5068680644035339, 0.0, -1.9788545614574105e-05, -0.06736865639686584, -0.0019315887475386262, -0.7544947862625122, -1.2993727978027891e-05, -4.768370445162873e-07, -0.03572460636496544, -0.3063563108444214, 0.0, -1.764281842042692e-05, -0.0012897277483716607, 0.0, -4.768370445162873e-07, -0.008408855646848679, -0.12557663023471832, -0.630459725856781, -0.6067289710044861, -0.15551187098026276, -0.9467446804046631, -0.32670366764068604, -0.3179912567138672, -0.7347063422203064, 0.0, -0.8765631318092346, -0.00017510310863144696, 0.0, -0.0029240967705845833, -0.46230047941207886, -0.03806964308023453, -0.5066084861755371, -0.031062226742506027, -0.36105555295944214, -1.1133415699005127, -1.2268264293670654, -0.1954253762960434, -0.023245446383953094, 0.0, -5.9126061387360096e-05, -0.03634750470519066, -0.15715888142585754, -0.429034948348999, -0.0004996005445718765, -0.2509430944919586, -0.41822245717048645], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": -1.764281842042692e-05, "The": -0.14805704355239868, "▁Bible": -0.5134298205375671, ",": -0.0029240967705845833, "▁which": -0.024606870487332344, "▁was": -0.2509430944919586, "▁lost": -1.0421019792556763, "▁in": -0.06736865639686584, "▁the": -0.5068680644035339, "▁USA": -0.720262885093689, "▁has": -0.023247426375746727, "▁been": -0.00010477947944309562, "▁returned": -0.001984414178878069, "▁to": -1.1444026313256472e-05, "▁family": -0.0007457336178049445, "▁of": -0.0008571050129830837, "▁original": 0.0, "▁owner": -1.9788545614574105e-05, "▁Scotland": -0.0019315887475386262, ".": -0.15715888142585754, "##": -0.3063563108444214, "#": 0.0, "Art": -0.0012897277483716607, "icle": 0.0, ":": -4.768370445162873e-07, "▁The": -0.429034948348999, "▁": -0.1954253762960434, "1": -0.03634750470519066, "9": 0.0, "6": -5.9126061387360096e-05, "▁film": -0.0004996005445718765, "▁directed": -0.7347063422203064, "▁by": 0.0, "▁Stanley": -0.8765631318092346, "▁Kub": -0.00017510310863144696, "rick": 0.0, "▁released": -0.41822245717048645, "▁on": -0.5066084861755371, "7": -1.1133415699005127, "▁April": -1.2268264293670654}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

She had last been seen alive at 08:00 that day. Mrs Logie had sustained head injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene by the Scottish Ambulance Service. Her family paid tribute to the \"beloved mother, grandmother and friend\". They said Mrs Logie would be sadly missed, adding that she was \"born, bred and lived in the Leven area all her life\". \"The family are assisting the police in the investigation and wish to be left alone at this difficult time,\" they added. Detectives said there were no signs of a break in and so far no clear motive but they said Mrs Logie was murdered in \"a brutal\" way. Mrs Logie was said to be independent, capable and was an active member of the local church. She had spent the festive period with one of her sons in England, returning home in the new year. Police said Mrs Logie's neighbour had spoken to her in the morning. She told the neighbour she was going to the shops and then to the hospital to visit a friend. When the neighbour did not hear from Mrs Logie again he went to investigate and found her dead in her home. Det Ch Insp Keith Hardie, of Police Scotland, said: \"She had a brutal head injury. \"An 82-year-old woman in the safety of her own home being subjected to such a brutal attack is horrendous.\" \"Whoever has been responsible for causing Mary's death has preyed on a vulnerable and elderly member of the community and we are pursuing various lines of inquiry as part of this ongoing investigation. \"I would ask that anyone who remembers seeing anything suspicious in the Green Gates area in the days and hours before Mary was found contacts police immediately. \"In addition, anyone with any other information that can help us find Mary's killer should also get in touch.\" Mrs Logan's local Church of Scotland minister said the whole community had been \"shocked\" and \"stunned\" by the murder. The Rev Gilbert Nisbet, of Leven Parish Church, said: \"Mary was part of the church community and very much involved in the life of the church. \"I have been the minister here for nine years and she came virtually every Sunday and I would chat to her at the door. \"Mary was friendly and outgoing, a kind lady who was bright and interesting to talk to.

The hosts, slacker after the break, had beleaguered striker Larnell Cole sent-off after he confronted the referee. Liam Craig sealed the win from the penalty spot with two minutes to play, before Graham Cummins finished a sumptuous stoppage-time move. And things got worse still for Caley Thistle after the match, with captain Gary Warren shown a red card in the tunnel. Saints remain five points clear of Hearts in fourth place, and closed the gap on third-placed Rangers, who play Aberdeen on Sunday, to three points. With game after game ticking past, Inverness' position looks increasingly perilous. Next weekend's trip to Motherwell, second-bottom on goal difference, is now seismic. This contest turned nightmarish for the hosts after a bright opening, but the truth is, given their predicament, Caley Thistle did not threaten St Johnstone's goal enough. Billy Mckay sent a shot over from close range. Alex Fisher nodded a diving header wide. Carl Tremarco miscued a volley. Greg Tansey did draw a save from Alan Mannus when he rasped in an effort from outside the box, but Richie Foran's side never looked likely to find the net. Their best opportunity came immediately after the Saints went ahead, when Tansey fed Cole, who seemed to panic in a terrific position and shot straight at Mannus. Cole's dismissal ended the contest when he appeared to be cautioned twice for challenging referee Stephen Finnie's decision not to award a foul. St Johnstone were merciless and could have had more. With just one win from their last 21 league games, Inverness look deep in trouble. Tommy Wright's side deserve so much credit. Saints were tactically brilliant, so strong defensively and ruthlessly capitalised on their man advantage. They took one of their few first-half chances when Michael Coulson broke down the left and sent a dangerous ball across the six-yard box. Owain Fon Williams could only parry into the danger area, Cummins' shot was blocked but Maclean followed up to force it home. They should have had another when Craig's superb curling corner flew all the way to the back post where Cummins slid in and somehow knocked it over from two yards. Craig, in his 300th appearance for the club, coolly converted a spot-kick after Cummins was tripped to seal the points. Cummins then slammed home after Miller danced around the area to tee him up, before Craig cracked the bar amid the late flurry. With a tendency to finish the season strongly, and just a three-point gap to Rangers, the Perth side look capable of something special this term. Inverness CT manager Richie Foran: \"It is a tough time of the season to be sitting bottom, and I need real men to stand up to that, but not enough of them did that today. \"It is pure luck we are still in it and it is only four points. I sound like a broken record but one win changes it - that is the truth.

A separate IS attack on the north-eastern city of Hassakeh has displaced 60,000 people, the UN says. Kobane became a symbol of Kurdish resistance in January after an IS siege lasting several months was repelled. IS launched an apparent two-pronged offensive on Thursday after Kurdish fighters from the Popular Protection Units (YPG) cut off one of the militants' major supply routes near Raqqa. Raqqa is the de facto capital of the IS \"caliphate\", whose creation IS announced a year ago after it captured large swathes of northern and western Iraq and parts of Syria. \"According to medical sources and Kobane residents, 120 civilians were executed by IS in their homes or killed by the group's rockets or snipers,\" said Rami Abdel Rahman, who heads the UK-based Observatory. He said women and children were among the bodies found inside houses and on the streets of the town, which is close to the border with Turkey. He described it as one of the biggest massacres by the group in the country since its offensive began last summer. The militants took the town by surprise when they launched their attack on Thursday, five months after IS was removed by Kurdish fighters backed by US-led coalition strikes. The attack at dawn on Thursday began when militants detonated a car bomb, followed by two more bombings. Reports said some of the militants may have hidden themselves among returning refugees and disguised themselves by wearing Kurdish militia uniforms. In a nearby village, IS reportedly shot dead at least 20 civilians, including women and children. Activists say clashes between some IS militants and the Kurdish YPG forces are continuing in the town. Separately on Friday, the UN said an estimated 50,000 people had been displaced within the city of Hassakeh after another IS offensive there. Another 10,000 have fled northwards towards a town near the Turkish border, it added. Hassakeh, about 270km (180 miles) east of Kobane, has been under the control of both government forces and Kurdish fighters, and IS militants have been trying to capture it for months. Overall, in four years of armed conflict in Syria, more than 200,000 people have lost their lives and more than 11 million others have been forced from their homes.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nIS militants entered the Syrian town of Kobane and massacred dozens of civilians, including women and children, before being pushed back by Kurdish fighters, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.</s", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "IS", "▁milit", "ants", "▁entered", "▁the", "▁Sy", "rian", "▁town", "▁of", "▁Kob", "ane", "▁and", "▁mass", "ac", "red", "▁do", "z", "ens", "▁of", "▁civ", "ili", "ans", ",", "▁including", "▁women", "▁and", "▁children", ",", "▁before", "▁being", "▁pushed", "▁back", "▁by", "▁Kur", "d", "ish", "▁f", "igh", "ters", ",", "▁according", "▁to", "▁the", "▁Sy", "rian", "▁Observ", "atory", "▁for", "▁Human", "▁Rights", ".", "</s>"], "token_logprobs": [-1.6689286894688848e-06, -0.4264187812805176, -0.001967876683920622, 0.0, -0.9431076645851135, -0.00010442188795423135, -0.07888974994421005, 0.0, -4.6491513785440475e-06, 0.0, 0.0, -0.00036459474358707666, -0.08633214235305786, -0.9483060836791992, 0.0, 0.0, -0.07511594146490097, 0.0, -1.1920928244535389e-07, 0.0, -5.364403477869928e-06, -1.6689286894688848e-06, 0.0, -5.638440416078083e-05, -0.00034648136352188885, -0.0029240967705845833, 0.0, -1.311301275563892e-06, -6.9141146923357155e-06, -0.020242534577846527, -1.311301275563892e-06, -0.05390697717666626, -0.00036459474358707666, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.00010442188795423135, 0.0, 0.0, -0.25192904472351074, -1.2040065485052764e-05, 0.0, -0.17577829957008362, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -1.2993727978027891e-05, -0.05271269008517265], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": -1.6689286894688848e-06, "IS": -0.4264187812805176, "▁milit": -0.001967876683920622, "ants": 0.0, "▁entered": -0.9431076645851135, "▁the": -0.17577829957008362, "▁Sy": 0.0, "rian": 0.0, "▁town": -4.6491513785440475e-06, "▁of": 0.0, "▁Kob": 0.0, "ane": -0.00036459474358707666, "▁and": 0.0, "▁mass": -0.9483060836791992, "ac": 0.0, "red": 0.0, "▁do": -0.07511594146490097, "z": 0.0, "ens": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "▁civ": -5.364403477869928e-06, "ili": -1.6689286894688848e-06, "ans": 0.0, ",": -0.25192904472351074, "▁including": -0.00034648136352188885, "▁women": -0.0029240967705845833, "▁children": -1.311301275563892e-06, "▁before": -0.020242534577846527, "▁being": -1.311301275563892e-06, "▁pushed": -0.05390697717666626, "▁back": -0.00036459474358707666, "▁by": 0.0, "▁Kur": 0.0, "d": 0.0, "ish": 0.0, "▁f": -0.00010442188795423135, "igh": 0.0, "ters": 0.0, "▁according": -1.2040065485052764e-05, "▁to": 0.0, "▁Observ": 0.0, "atory": 0.0, "▁for": 0.0, "▁Human": 0.0, "▁Rights": 0.0, ".": -1.2993727978027891e-05, "</s>": -0.05271269008517265}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

But many are put off - because a licence can cost ??1,000 - despite facing a fine of up to ??20,000, Southampton City Council said. The authority estimated a total of 1,500 unlicensed HMOs in the area. Shelter helpline adviser Nadeem Khan said fear of eviction and living in poorly maintained properties are frequent concerns raised by HMO tenants. \"Because of the huge shortage of affordable homes people are being forced into rented homes which are unregulated. We receive about five or six calls a day about this,\" he said. Nationally, mandatory licensing for HMOs is aimed at houses of three storeys or more and occupied by five or more unrelated people. In Southampton, the licences affect properties in Bargate, Bevois, Portswood, Swaythling (Designation 1 - introduced in 2013) and in Shirley Freemantle, Millbrook, and Bassett (Designation 2 - introduced in 2015). A council spokesman said: \"Landlords have generally co-operated with the regime, but a small minority have resisted applying for their licence.\" The council said it had so far gained prosecutions against one firm and 13 individuals.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nLandlords in Southampton are being urged to apply for licences to let out properties to multiple tenants, with those who fail to comply facing fines of up to £28,000.\n\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "Land", "l", "ords", "▁in", "▁South", "am", "pton", "▁are", "▁being", "▁ur", "ged", "▁to", "▁apply", "▁for", "▁lic", "ences", "▁to", "▁let", "▁out", "▁properties", "▁to", "▁multiple", "▁ten", "ants", ",", "▁with", "▁those", "▁who", "▁fail", "▁to", "▁comp", "ly", "▁facing", "▁fin", "es", "▁of", "▁up", "▁to", "▁£", "2", "8", ",", "0", "0", "0", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁The", "▁", "3", "0", "-", "year", "-", "old"], "token_logprobs": [-3.576278118089249e-07, -0.3629291355609894, -5.602679812000133e-05, -1.6689286894688848e-06, -0.1871577352285385, -0.0001811817055568099, -4.6491513785440475e-06, -3.576278118089249e-07, -0.06277727335691452, -0.0006983225466683507, -0.08873024582862854, 0.0, 0.0, -0.0052713449113070965, -3.576278118089249e-07, -0.05274921655654907, -0.000735608336981386, -0.29411593079566956, -0.5963630080223083, -0.035913918167352676, -0.11941450089216232, -0.002199494047090411, -0.02858402393758297, -0.12085624039173126, 0.0, -0.14301498234272003, -0.012958717532455921, -0.16754847764968872, -0.05279003828763962, -0.0008403107640333474, 0.0, -0.6931471824645996, -3.576278118089249e-07, -6.675497570540756e-05, -2.4676019165781327e-05, 0.0, -0.05272761732339859, -3.576278118089249e-07, 0.0, -4.625213477993384e-05, -0.0003694805200211704, -0.0005608416395261884, 0.0, -6.437280717364047e-06, 0.0, 0.0, -0.0008687774534337223, -0.2519357204437256, -7.152555099310121e-07, -8.583032467868179e-06, -0.07921457290649414, 0.0, -1.311301275563892e-06, -0.004432139918208122, 0.0, 0.0, -0.012819028459489346, -0.0017507239244878292, -0.40735024213790894, -1.1747093200683594, -2.109982233378105e-05, -3.909988299710676e-05, -3.814689989667386e-06, -1.1920928244535389e-07], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": -1.311301275563892e-06, "Land": -0.3629291355609894, "l": -5.602679812000133e-05, "ords": -1.6689286894688848e-06, "▁in": -0.1871577352285385, "▁South": -0.0001811817055568099, "am": -4.6491513785440475e-06, "pton": -3.576278118089249e-07, "▁are": -0.06277727335691452, "▁being": -0.0006983225466683507, "▁ur": -0.08873024582862854, "ged": 0.0, "▁to": 0.0, "▁apply": -0.0052713449113070965, "▁for": -3.576278118089249e-07, "▁lic": -0.05274921655654907, "ences": -0.000735608336981386, "▁let": -0.5963630080223083, "▁out": -0.035913918167352676, "▁properties": -0.11941450089216232, "▁multiple": -0.02858402393758297, "▁ten": -0.12085624039173126, "ants": 0.0, ",": 0.0, "▁with": -0.012958717532455921, "▁those": -0.16754847764968872, "▁who": -0.05279003828763962, "▁fail": -0.0008403107640333474, "▁comp": -0.6931471824645996, "ly": -3.576278118089249e-07, "▁facing": -6.675497570540756e-05, "▁fin": -2.4676019165781327e-05, "es": 0.0, "▁of": -0.05272761732339859, "▁up": -3.576278118089249e-07, "▁£": -4.625213477993384e-05, "2": -0.0003694805200211704, "8": -0.0005608416395261884, "0": -1.1747093200683594, ".": -0.0008687774534337223, "##": -0.07921457290649414, "#": 0.0, "Art": -0.004432139918208122, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "▁The": -0.012819028459489346, "▁": -0.0017507239244878292, "3": -0.40735024213790894, "-": -3.814689989667386e-06, "year": -3.909988299710676e-05, "old": -1.1920928244535389e-07}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

Since the days of Jesus and his 12 male apostles the Church has had exclusively male leaders - bishops whose authority has been handed down the generations by the laying on of hands. Hilary Cotton chairs Women and the Church, which campaigns for women bishops. \"Saying yes to women bishops is a cosmic shift,\" she says. \"It changes our whole understanding of what God intended people to be, and even changes the Church's theology by recognising that men and women are equally chosen to lead it.\" A senior figure on the \"high church\" wing of the Anglicanism, Prebendary David Houlding, says creating women bishops represents \"a massive shift\" in the way the Church presented itself to the world. \"It's an unprecedented acceptance by the Church of the secular values of society\", he says. \"There was a lot of damage to the Church's reputation when the measure was defeated before. It's terrified of sending the wrong signal again.\" Samuel Margrave, who also opposes the legislation, told the Synod: \"This is a show for the media. It's the end of the Church as we know it.\" The Reverend Lindsay Southern, the Vicar of Catterick in North Yorkshire, who supports the proposals, said a single vote for woman bishops would have huge long-term effects. \"It might look like a small change in direction from the outside, but it's like a ship at sea - a change in course over time will lead us to a completely different place.\" Women now constitute a third of the 11,000 Anglican priests, several of whom have reached senior positions. The Church's 42 dioceses have given unanimous backing to the latest proposals. But to take such a profound step, each of the Synod's three houses - representing bishops, clergy and lay people - needed to support legislation to create women bishops by a majority of two-thirds. The legislation failed in November 2012 because lay synod members who supported women bishops nevertheless believed that traditionalists were not getting sufficient exemptions from serving under them. The latest proposals would allow traditionalist parishes to ask a woman bishop for a male alternative, and take any dispute over the process to an independent ombudsman. \"There will be an 'expectation' that bishops will do their best to accommodate (traditionalist) parishes,\" says Prebendary Rod Thomas, the leader of the conservative evangelical group, Reform. \"But in the end it depends on trust, and that is the big question. Will there be trust?\" Evangelical traditionalists oppose women bishops because of their belief that the Bible calls for men to head churches. Traditionalists on the Catholic, or High Church, wing of Anglicanism believe that because Jesus chose only men to make up his 12 apostles, only men should lead the Church. In fact some do not believe that women can be priests, so that were a woman bishop to ordain a man as a priest, he\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nThe Church of England has voted to allow women to become bishops, breaking a 2,000-year tradition of male-only leadership.</s", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "The", "▁Church", "▁of", "▁England", "▁has", "▁voted", "▁to", "▁allow", "▁women", "▁to", "▁become", "▁b", "ish", "ops", ",", "▁breaking", "▁a", "▁", "2", ",", "0", "0", "0", "-", "year", "▁tradition", "▁of", "▁male", "-", "only", "▁leadership", ".", "</s>"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -1.6689286894688848e-06, -1.6689286894688848e-06, 0.0, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -0.0001656871900195256, -6.961580220377073e-05, -0.015384926460683346, -3.576278118089249e-07, -5.483612312673358e-06, -0.0005529781919904053, -0.023245446383953094, -7.152555099310121e-07, 0.0, 0.0, -1.4781842764932662e-05, -0.04363598674535751, -0.00015853578224778175, -0.0012735360069200397, 0.0, -0.0005529781919904053, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.015385161153972149, 0.0, -0.0008685392094776034, -3.1709168979432434e-05, -0.003006820799782872, -0.25327783823013306, 0.0, -0.02324567921459675, -2.9801878554280847e-05, -0.17303311824798584], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "The": -1.6689286894688848e-06, "▁Church": -1.6689286894688848e-06, "▁of": -3.1709168979432434e-05, "▁England": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "▁has": -0.0001656871900195256, "▁voted": -6.961580220377073e-05, "▁to": -0.0005529781919904053, "▁allow": -3.576278118089249e-07, "▁women": -5.483612312673358e-06, "▁become": -0.023245446383953094, "▁b": -7.152555099310121e-07, "ish": 0.0, "ops": 0.0, ",": -0.0005529781919904053, "▁breaking": -0.04363598674535751, "▁a": -0.00015853578224778175, "▁": -0.0012735360069200397, "2": 0.0, "0": 0.0, "-": -0.25327783823013306, "year": 0.0, "▁tradition": -0.0008685392094776034, "▁male": -0.003006820799782872, "only": 0.0, "▁leadership": -0.02324567921459675, ".": -2.9801878554280847e-05, "</s>": -0.17303311824798584}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

The pathway had been damaged by storms and record rainfall, according to Mid and East Antrim Borough Council. Its bridge structures have not been damaged and the council plans to restore access and reopen the coastal pathway \"as soon as possible\". However, no date has yet been set for when the public can expect to use the path again. \"Mid and East Antrim Borough Council wishes to ensure that all experiences at The Gobbins are safe and enjoyable and the health and safety of our visitors is of paramount importance,\" a council spokesperson said. \"We are working to have the path reopened as soon as possible and apologise for any inconvenience caused.\" The Gobbins Visitor Centre and exhibition remains open to the public while the repairs are being carried out. The original Edwardian structure first opened in 1902 but fell into disrepair and closed to the public in the 1950s. In August last year, it was unveiled as the council's newest tourist attraction. The path is carved into black basalt cliffs and is connected by a network of walkways and bridges, including a new tubular bridge which is an almost identical replica of the original Edwardian structure.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "The gobbins were carved into black basalt cliffs and is connected by network of walkways and is connected by a new tubular bridge which is carved into black basalt cliffs and is connected by a new tubular bridge which is connected by a new tubular bridge which is carved into blac", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["▁The", "▁g", "obb", "ins", "▁were", "▁car", "ved", "▁into", "▁black", "▁bas", "alt", "▁cl", "iffs", "▁and", "▁is", "▁connected", "▁by", "▁network", "▁of", "▁walk", "ways", "▁and", "▁is", "▁connected", "▁by", "▁a", "▁new", "▁tub", "ular", "▁bridge", "▁which", "▁is", "▁car", "ved", "▁into", "▁black", "▁bas", "alt", "▁cl", "iffs", "▁and", "▁is", "▁connected", "▁by", "▁a", "▁new", "▁tub", "ular", "▁bridge", "▁which", "▁is", "▁connected", "▁by", "▁a", "▁new", "▁tub", "ular", "▁bridge", "▁which", "▁is", "▁car", "ved", "▁into", "▁black"], "token_logprobs": [-0.2949983477592468, -0.03188735619187355, -0.0008386432309634984, 0.0, -0.7292643785476685, -0.7746197581291199, -0.0004234609368722886, -0.00011777184408856556, -0.1007121279835701, -0.00334251974709332, -3.3378546504536644e-06, -0.008502474054694176, -7.510157047363464e-06, -0.001111009274609387, -0.0032329694367945194, -0.00045980370487086475, -0.005653700791299343, -0.5979957580566406, -1.6689286894688848e-06, -0.016530809924006462, -9.536738616588991e-07, -0.003761598840355873, -0.06701676547527313, -0.03915052488446236, -0.005491054616868496, -0.060463495552539825, -0.30232277512550354, -0.10665909200906754, -3.576278118089249e-07, -0.00031931069679558277, -0.08244498819112778, -0.0029965995345264673, -0.21336576342582703, 0.0, -1.4066597032069694e-05, -0.0037822630256414413, -0.0020926736760884523, -1.0728830375228426e-06, -0.0015832758508622646, -8.583032467868179e-06, -0.003730482654646039, -0.0005918181850574911, -0.005910774692893028, -0.0001357701694360003, -0.024174446240067482, -0.0005626287311315536, -0.0004978132783435285, 0.0, -5.364403477869928e-06, -0.01679377816617489, -1.883488948806189e-05, -0.2621223032474518, -8.594620157964528e-05, -0.00011991735664196312, -0.002395024523139, -9.417090768693015e-05, 0.0, -1.3351351299206726e-05, -0.017244169488549232, -2.7418097943154862e-06, -0.25202837586402893, 0.0, -1.3112935448589269e-05, -0.004493259359151125], "top_logprobs": [{"▁The": -0.2949983477592468, "▁g": -0.03188735619187355, "obb": -0.0008386432309634984, "ins": 0.0, "▁were": -0.7292643785476685, "▁car": -0.25202837586402893, "ved": 0.0, "▁into": -1.3112935448589269e-05, "▁black": -0.004493259359151125, "▁bas": -0.0020926736760884523, "alt": -1.0728830375228426e-06, "▁cl": -0.0015832758508622646, "iffs": -8.583032467868179e-06, "▁and": -0.003730482654646039, "▁is": -2.7418097943154862e-06, "▁connected": -0.2621223032474518, "▁by": -8.594620157964528e-05, "▁network": -0.5979957580566406, "▁of": -1.6689286894688848e-06, "▁walk": -0.016530809924006462, "ways": -9.536738616588991e-07, "▁a": -0.00011991735664196312, "▁new": -0.002395024523139, "▁tub": -9.417090768693015e-05, "ular": 0.0, "▁bridge": -1.3351351299206726e-05, "▁which": -0.017244169488549232}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

Simpson shot 68 to set the target at one over and watched as 2010 champion McDowell missed a 25ft putt to force a play-off on the 18th. Lee Westwood took 73 for five over, while Tiger Woods (73) was seven over. Clubhouse scores in full Simpson, who climbs to fifth in the world, becomes the 15th different major winner in a row, the ninth straight first-time winner and the third consecutive American to win one of golf's grand slam events. \"I've never felt nerves like I felt today,\" said Simpson, who was pipped to the US money list title by England's Luke Donald last year. \"I had to hit my legs because I couldn't feel them. \"I probably prayed more the last three holes than I ever did in my life.\" Starting the final day four shots behind co-leaders McDowell and Jim Furyk, Simpson made his move with a spell of four birdies in five holes from the sixth. Parring his way home, he bettered the clubhouse mark of first-round leader Thompson, who shot 67, and took the outright lead when Furyk, who had been in front all day and led by two at one stage, bogeyed 16. Both 2003 champion Furyk and McDowell had a chance to force an 18-hole play-off on Monday, but the 42-year-old American finished with another bogey via the left bunker on 18 for a 74 to end two back and McDowell could only make par for a 73. \"It was grind and a slog, but I'll be back,\" said the 32-year-old McDowell, who had hoped to make it three Northern Irish wins in a row following Rory McIlroy's success last June. \"There's a mixture of emotions inside me right now, disappointment, deflation, pride but mostly just frustration.\" Furyk, whose hooked drive on the par-five 16th sparked his downfall, said: \"I don't know how to put that one into words, but I had my opportunities and my chances and it was right there. \"On that back nine, it was my tournament to win. I've only got myself to blame.\" Ireland's Padraig Harrington put up a serious challenge for a fourth major title and first since 2008 with a run of five birdies in 11 holes. But needing a birdie at the last to join Thompson, he ran up a bogey five after finding sand with his approach and ended with a 68 to finish three over. Americans David Toms (68), John Peterson (70) and Jason Dufner (70) also finished three over with 1994 and 1997 US Open winner Ernie Els on four over. The South African, who was third to McDowell at Pebble Beach, was one stroke off the lead after 15 but bogeyed the 16th and 18th for a 72. We shouldn't be too surprised at Simpson's victory.

Powers to change speed limits are to be handed to the Welsh Government, although it is not clear exactly when. But road safety charity Brake said the proposals were \"disappointing\" and suggested a change would lead to more deaths on the roads. In 2015, UK ministers suggested limits could be raised in some areas of England and Wales. Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies said: \"The M4 and A55 are vital arteries in the Welsh economy with thousands of commuters relying on their use every day. \"Welsh Conservatives believe that raising the speed limit from 70mph to 80mph [112km/h to 128km/h] could play a vital role in getting our economy moving and offering invaluable support to hard-pressed motorists, commuters and businesses. \"Consultation would be key - ensuring the views of all stakeholders are considered, so any change on the M4 and A55 is delivered with safety paramount.\" But Brake spokesman Jack Kushner said: \"We urge the government to reject needless proposals to increase speed limits to 80mph. We're disappointed it is being considered. \"Evidence from previous consultations made it clear that an increase would not only be dangerous - potentially 25 more deaths and 100 more serious injuries each year - but also highly damaging to the environment and economy.\" Political parties should focus instead on greater investment in \"sustainable\" travel and rural transport, he added.

They were one of only two sides to earn a point at Ibrox in the league last season, and Duffy insists they will make it \"as uncomfortable as possible\". \"[A Morton win] would be a monumental upset,\" he told BBC Scotland. \"Rangers are a different proposition at Ibrox. Even though they drew last weekend [1-1 v Ross County], their home form has been very good over the last couple of years under Mark Warburton. \"The pitch, the expanse at Ibrox certainly suits the style they play. But we will certainly go there with a bit more heart after last night [the win at Raith]. \"The heavy pitch took its toll so we have to make sure we recover right and prepare tactically as well. \"We will go there and try to make it as uncomfortable a day as we possibly can for Rangers. If we play well, manage to stifle Rangers a little bit and keep the ball, we can frustrate them.\" With last season's Championship winners Rangers 27 points behind Celtic in the Premiership, Duffy believes Warburton's side will place extra emphasis on Sunday's fifth-round tie. \"The nature of being a big club like Rangers is the expectations are huge,\" noted the former Dundee centre-back and manager. \"They know it is their only chance of silverware this season. Celtic have already got the League Cup, and have all but wrapped up the league, so the only trophy available to Rangers and their supporters is the Scottish Cup. \"That will be the main objective and target now which will make it doubly difficult for us because all their focus will be on that. \"But we have got a job to do - to stay in the game and be difficult to beat. If Rangers get a little bit nervous, and their fans get frustrated, then you never know. But we have to be good enough to take advantage of those situations.\" Media playback is not supported on this device Morton's victory at Stark's Park lifted them to within two points of second-placed Dundee United and nine off Championship leaders Hibernian, but crucially, nine points clear of fifth-placed Queen of the South in the battle for a play-off place. Duffy believes a prospect of a tilt at the title is unrealistic, insisting a play-off spot will be a significant achievement for the Greenock outfit. \"If we get into the play-offs, we will be singing and dancing, there is no doubt about that,\" he added. \"But it is still a long way away. A lot of clubs will be challenging for that. There will be clubs that can find a run of form and you can have a dip. \"But the players showed terrific character to bounce back from a disappointing weekend [losing to Queen of the South] and it sets us up nicely for the Scottish Cup tie against Rangers.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nMorton's manager says his team will go to Ibrox and make it as uncomfortable as possible for Rangers in their bid to secure a Championship play-off spot.\n\n\n\n</s", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "M", "orton", "'", "s", "▁manager", "▁says", "▁his", "▁team", "▁will", "▁go", "▁to", "▁I", "bro", "x", "▁and", "▁make", "▁it", "▁as", "▁un", "com", "fort", "able", "▁as", "▁possible", "▁for", "▁R", "angers", "▁in", "▁their", "▁bid", "▁to", "▁secure", "▁a", "▁Championship", "▁play", "-", "off", "▁spot", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "</s>"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -2.0265373677830212e-05, -2.3841855067985307e-07, -0.598936915397644, 0.0, -0.19565527141094208, -0.39711910486221313, -0.075556181371212, -0.11735421419143677, -0.10563839972019196, -0.5502328276634216, -0.0006871246150694788, -0.0012738931691274047, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -3.576278118089249e-07, -0.11906681209802628, -0.0790092721581459, -0.0019342063460499048, -0.00015877417172305286, -0.3617802858352661, 0.0, -8.332382276421413e-05, 0.0, -0.0001045410826918669, -3.576278118089249e-07, -5.364403477869928e-06, -4.768370445162873e-07, 0.0, -0.567571222782135, -0.004539066925644875, -0.0728359967470169, -0.1730077564716339, -0.14329153299331665, 0.0, -0.005460466258227825, 0.0, -4.541770613286644e-05, 0.0, -0.0008386432309634984, -4.768370445162873e-07, -0.05271913483738899, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -0.0003461238811723888, -0.47639161348342896, -0.0690993145108223], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": -0.47639161348342896, "M": -2.0265373677830212e-05, "orton": -2.3841855067985307e-07, "'": -0.598936915397644, "s": 0.0, "▁manager": -0.19565527141094208, "▁says": -0.39711910486221313, "▁his": -0.075556181371212, "▁team": -0.11735421419143677, "▁will": -0.10563839972019196, "▁go": -0.5502328276634216, "▁to": -0.1730077564716339, "▁I": -0.0012738931691274047, "bro": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "x": -3.576278118089249e-07, "▁and": -0.11906681209802628, "▁make": -0.0790092721581459, "▁it": -0.0019342063460499048, "▁as": -0.0001045410826918669, "▁un": -0.3617802858352661, "com": 0.0, "fort": -8.332382276421413e-05, "able": 0.0, "▁possible": -3.576278118089249e-07, "▁for": -5.364403477869928e-06, "▁R": -4.768370445162873e-07, "angers": 0.0, "▁in": -0.567571222782135, "▁their": -0.004539066925644875, "▁bid": -0.0728359967470169, "▁secure": -0.14329153299331665, "▁a": 0.0, "▁Championship": -0.005460466258227825, "▁play": 0.0, "-": -4.541770613286644e-05, "off": 0.0, "▁spot": -0.0008386432309634984, ".": -4.768370445162873e-07, "</s>": -0.0690993145108223}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

Some people think I'm exaggerating but without it he doesn't drink so personally I'm very relieved.\" Tommee Tippee will send the cups on demand for free to the Carter family. Mr Carter said: \"I would not be happier if I won the lottery. We've moved down to the middle of nowhere and don't want much. \"Just knowing he has got these cups gives us peace of mind.\" Northumberland-based Tommee Tippee does not normally keep the moulds but had been searching factories around the world in the hope of finding the original plans.

Jason Taylor, 21, of Westfield, Lostock Hall denied murder but was found guilty after a trial by jury. At Preston Court, he was ordered to serve a minimum of 25 years. Mr Wilson died as a result of catastrophic bleeding from a stab wound in his thigh, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said. Sophie Lorimer from the CPS North West said the \"brutal attack\" in front of his ex-partner was \"purely motivated by jealousy\". \"He could not accept that the relationship with his ex-girlfriend was over,\" she said. Taylor's girlfriend said he bombarded her with text messages and phone calls which \"progressively became more and more abusive\". \"The final text he sent to her stated he was giving her one last chance before things turned sour. \"Minutes later he violently broke into her house where Adam Wilson was also present.\" Ms Lorimer said Taylor then stabbed Mr Wilson numerous times with a large knife which he had taken with him. Taylor carried out the \"frenzied\" knife attack \"fully aware\" there were two young children also present at the house, she said.

College principal Chris Wilkes said the decision was related to \"low student numbers rather than any other reason\". He said it would continue to focus on adult education. Famous Ruskin College alumni include former deputy prime minister John Prescott and Dennis Skinner, MP for Bolsover in Derbyshire. BA English Studies, BA History with Social Sciences and MA Women's Studies are being discontinued. Anne Hughes, 63, from Thame in Oxfordshire, has been studying BA English Studies part-time at the college for two years. She said she was \"absolutely distraught\" it was being cut. She is physically disabled and has depression, and said she chose to study at the college because it worked with \"disadvantaged, disabled and mature students\". The college also offers bespoke timetables, unlike some other places of higher education, she added. Online petitions have been set up in a bid to save the English faculty and the Women's Studies course. One signatory, Jenny Lewis, wrote on the first petition: \"[Tutors] Helen Kidd and Tom Sherry are carrying on the great Ruskin tradition of bringing opportunities to those that otherwise would not have them.\" Student and activist Saskia Ritchie, who set up the second petition, said Ruskin had been set up for \"people who would traditionally be excluded from academia\" and gives \"access to truly excellent learning opportunities\". Mr Wilkes said the college would lose about 25 students as a result of the cuts. He added degrees had been on offer at the college for about 10 years and were \"relatively new\" considering the college's 116-year history. \"Our focus will continue to be on educating adults and I think what we're doing is just renewing our offer but doing it in a different way, fulfilling our mission in a different way, to perhaps how we've done it in the past,\" Mr Wilkes added. The college previously lost funding from the Skills Development Agency.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nRuskin College in Oxford is cutting three of its degree courses due to low student numbers, a decision that has prompted online petitions and criticism from former students.</s", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "R", "us", "kin", "▁College", "▁in", "▁Oxford", "▁is", "▁cutting", "▁three", "▁of", "▁its", "▁degree", "▁courses", "▁due", "▁to", "▁low", "▁student", "▁numbers", ",", "▁a", "▁decision", "▁that", "▁has", "▁prompt", "ed", "▁online", "▁pet", "itions", "▁and", "▁criticism", "▁from", "▁former", "▁students", ".", "</s>"], "token_logprobs": [-1.1920928244535389e-07, -0.03014145791530609, 0.0, 0.0, -4.768360213347478e-06, -0.0033905182499438524, -0.0004489606071729213, -0.14716532826423645, -0.36226949095726013, -0.00041547726141288877, -0.008944680914282799, -4.768370445162873e-07, -0.09952769428491592, -0.010406989604234695, -0.02065342478454113, 0.0, -4.029192859889008e-05, -1.9907753085135482e-05, 0.0, -0.017985939979553223, -1.100609540939331, -0.0012748456792905927, -5.113947918289341e-05, 0.0, -0.03521214798092842, 0.0, -0.007894977927207947, -4.768370445162873e-07, 0.0, -0.0008841419476084411, -0.15202674269676208, -0.03510730341076851, -0.4850919246673584, 0.0, -7.152555099310121e-07, -0.5063884854316711], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "R": -0.03014145791530609, "us": 0.0, "kin": 0.0, "▁College": -4.768360213347478e-06, "▁in": -0.0033905182499438524, "▁Oxford": -0.0004489606071729213, "▁is": -0.14716532826423645, "▁cutting": -0.36226949095726013, "▁three": -0.00041547726141288877, "▁of": -0.008944680914282799, "▁its": -4.768370445162873e-07, "▁degree": -0.09952769428491592, "▁courses": -0.010406989604234695, "▁due": -0.02065342478454113, "▁to": 0.0, "▁low": -4.029192859889008e-05, "▁student": -1.9907753085135482e-05, "▁numbers": 0.0, ",": -0.017985939979553223, "▁a": -1.100609540939331, "▁decision": -0.0012748456792905927, "▁that": -5.113947918289341e-05, "▁has": 0.0, "▁prompt": -0.03521214798092842, "ed": 0.0, "▁online": -0.007894977927207947, "▁pet": -4.768370445162873e-07, "itions": 0.0, "▁and": -0.0008841419476084411, "▁criticism": -0.15202674269676208, "▁from": -0.03510730341076851, "▁former": -0.4850919246673584, "▁students": 0.0, ".": -7.152555099310121e-07, "</s>": -0.5063884854316711}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

The Mental Health Network suspects the funding has been used to support other NHS services. NHS England says it can show where the money has been allocated. The additional funding was part of a £1.25bn investment over five years announced by the chancellor in the Budget in March 2015. While campaigners expected £250m to be made available this year, the Department of Health said in August that only £143m would be spent, as providers did not have the capacity to spend any more. However, the body representing mental health trusts says it has seen little of even that reduced amount. How the £143m was allocated: Source: NHS England Stephen Dalton, chief executive of the mental health network which represents NHS providers, said: \"Providers of mental health services and most importantly children and families are struggling to see the difference. \"It doesn't seem to have turned into posts on the front line. We are not hearing any reports of any significant investment at a local level around children's services. Indeed, some services are still experiencing cuts in services.\" NHS England says it has provided £75m to clinical commissioning groups (CCGs), but NHS providers fear some of the money has been siphoned off to pay for other services. Acknowledging that is a possibility, CCGs have told BBC News they want NHS England to ring-fence the money, specifically for children's mental health services. Dr Phil Moore, chairman of the NHS Clinical Commissioners Mental Health Commissioners Network, said: \"Despite our commitment to better mental healthcare for young people, it has to be acknowledged that CCGs are dealing with increasingly financially challenging times and a myriad of competing demands on budgets. \"This, combined with the fact that children and young people's mental healthcare is in desperate need of heavy investment having historically been treated as a 'Cinderella service', is why we believe this is a rare case where funding should be ring-fenced.\" Some trusts say they have seen additional funding - the South London and Maudsley, for instance, said they had received an additional £1.8m from four separate CCGs. And several CCGs told us they were committed to spending the money on new services. But some children's mental health services are also being cut, especially those provided by councils. Dr Marc Bush, senior policy adviser at the charity Young Minds, said: \"Our expectation is that overall spending on children's mental health services this year may either be flat or fall slightly in real terms.\" Former care minister Norman Lamb, who helped secure the extra funding, said he was concerned about the lack of progress. \"Given the pressure on the whole system including local government, there is a real risk that funding intended for children's mental health ends up elsewhere or simply replaces other funding cuts. \"There is an absolute moral imperative to address the very serious underfunding of children's mental health. Failure to invest this money now would be unforgivable.\" An NHS England spokesman said: \"As a society we must make\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nMental health trusts in England have recieved £143m in additional funding, but only a small amount has been spent on frontline services, with some trusts facing cuts to children's mental health services.</s", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "M", "ental", "▁health", "▁trust", "s", "▁in", "▁England", "▁have", "▁rec", "ieved", "▁£", "1", "4", "3", "m", "▁in", "▁additional", "▁fund", "ing", ",", "▁but", "▁only", "▁a", "▁small", "▁amount", "▁has", "▁been", "▁spent", "▁on", "▁front", "line", "▁services", ",", "▁with", "▁some", "▁trust", "s", "▁facing", "▁cut", "s", "▁to", "▁children", "'", "s", "▁mental", "▁health", "▁services", ".", "</s>"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.09268404543399811, -6.079655122448457e-06, -1.3589766240329482e-05, -0.024621061980724335, 0.0, -0.4709359407424927, -9.179073458653875e-06, -0.6319648623466492, -0.6484354734420776, -0.0029240967705845833, -0.08253653347492218, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.004432139918208122, -0.3651784658432007, -0.43224334716796875, 0.0, 0.0, -0.3621310591697693, -5.61460001335945e-05, -1.134157419204712, -8.308542601298541e-05, -0.3612436354160309, -0.36527907848358154, -0.25201186537742615, -0.0029712836258113384, -0.026216259226202965, -0.004439142532646656, -0.002220071852207184, -0.0012029323261231184, -1.5735502529423684e-05, -0.3166782259941101, -0.2856176197528839, -0.0007155956700444221, -0.6100710034370422, -1.9788545614574105e-05, -0.3511696457862854, -0.00024041623692028224, -4.541770613286644e-05, -0.3613814413547516, -0.002591586671769619, 0.0, 0.0, -0.00010442188795423135, -3.576278118089249e-07, -2.3841855067985307e-07, -6.90197994117625e-05, -0.5063599348068237], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "M": -0.09268404543399811, "ental": -6.079655122448457e-06, "▁health": -3.576278118089249e-07, "▁trust": -0.6100710034370422, "s": 0.0, "▁in": -0.3651784658432007, "▁England": -9.179073458653875e-06, "▁have": -0.6319648623466492, "▁rec": -0.6484354734420776, "ieved": -0.0029240967705845833, "▁£": -0.08253653347492218, "1": 0.0, "4": 0.0, "3": 0.0, "m": -0.004432139918208122, "▁additional": -0.43224334716796875, "▁fund": 0.0, "ing": 0.0, ",": -0.3166782259941101, "▁but": -5.61460001335945e-05, "▁only": -1.134157419204712, "▁a": -8.308542601298541e-05, "▁small": -0.3612436354160309, "▁amount": -0.36527907848358154, "▁has": -0.25201186537742615, "▁been": -0.0029712836258113384, "▁spent": -0.026216259226202965, "▁on": -0.004439142532646656, "▁front": -0.002220071852207184, "line": -0.0012029323261231184, "▁services": -2.3841855067985307e-07, "▁with": -0.2856176197528839, "▁some": -0.0007155956700444221, "▁facing": -0.3511696457862854, "▁cut": -0.00024041623692028224, "▁to": -0.3613814413547516, "▁children": -0.002591586671769619, "'": 0.0, "▁mental": -0.00010442188795423135, ".": -6.90197994117625e-05, "</s>": -0.5063599348068237}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

Pwrpas y ddeddfwriaeth yw cynnig mwy o gefnogaeth i bobl sy'n byw gyda'r cyflwr. Mae'r mesur yn anelu at gyflwyno strategaeth ar gyfer diwallu anghenion plant ac oedolion yng Nghymru, a sicrhau bod cynghorau a byrddau iechyd yn deall ac yn cymryd y camau angenrheidiol er mwyn i blant ac oedolion dderbyn y cymorth sydd ei angen arnynt. Bydd pleidlais ar y Ddeddf Awtistiaeth yng Nghymru yn mynd ger bron aelodau'r cynulliad ddydd Mercher. Mabwysiadodd Cymru strategaeth awtistiaeth yn 2008 ac yn ddiweddar cafodd y strategaeth ei diweddaru i gynnwys targed amser aros penodol. Yr argymhelliad yw na fydd yn rhaid i blant ag awtistiaeth aros mwy na 26 wythnos cyn cael yr apwyntiad arbenigol cyntaf. Mae'r cynllun presennol ond yn para tan 2020. \"Be mae fy mil i'n ei wneud,\" medd Paul Davies, \"yw sicrhau bod y gwasanaethau yma yn fwy parhaol ynghyd â gosod sylfaen statudol i'r gwasanaethau.\" Er hynny, mae Steve Thomas, prif weithredwr Cymdeithas Llywodraeth Leol Cymru, wedi dweud wrth raglen Eye on Wales, BBC Radio Wales nad yw'n siwr bod angen deddfwriaeth o'r fath. Meddai: \"A ydy Cymru o dan anfantais i beidio â chael Deddf Awtistiaeth fel Lloegr? Dwi ddim yn gwybod i fod yn onest. Mae peth o'r gwaith sy'n digwydd yn y maes yng Nghymru yn arloesol.\" \"Rhaid sicrhau nad yw'r broses o ddeddfu yn amharu ar y gwaith sy'n digwydd ar hyn o bryd.\" Cafodd ymgais flaenorol gan y Ceidwadwyr i gael Llywodraeth Cymru i ymrwymo i ddeddfwriaeth ar awtistiaeth ei threchu yn y Senedd fis Hydref. Ond mae Paul Davies yn hyderus y bydd ei ymgais yn llwyddo: \"Rwy'n gobeithio y bydd y mesur yn digwydd. Yr oll dwi'n gofyn ar y funud yw bo fi'n cael amser bant i gyflwyno'r bil - bydd angen ymgynghori yn eang.\" Dywedodd Llywodraeth Cymru ei bod wedi ei hymrwymo i wella cefnogaeth i bobol gydag awtistiaeth wrth i £13m gael ei wario ar Wasanaeth Awtistiaeth Integredig Cenedlaethol yn ystod y pedair blynedd nesaf. Ychwanegodd llefarydd bod yna eisoes \"bolisïau a deddfau i gefnogi pomilag awtistiaeth\" ond y byddid yn cadw golwg ar y sefyllfa a phetai angen byddai deddfwriaeth yn cael ei chyflwyno.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nThe Welsh government has announced plans to sell off the country's historic monocle and xylophone used by Sir Patrick Moore, the former presenter of The Sky At Night, to raise funds for charity.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "The", "▁Wel", "sh", "▁government", "▁has", "▁announced", "▁plans", "▁to", "▁sell", "▁off", "▁the", "▁country", "'", "s", "▁historic", "▁mon", "oc", "le", "▁and", "▁x", "y", "lo", "phone", "▁used", "▁by", "▁Sir", "▁Patrick", "▁Moore", ",", "▁the", "▁former", "▁present", "er", "▁of", "▁The", "▁Sky", "▁At", "▁Night", ",", "▁to", "▁raise", "▁funds", "▁for", "▁char", "ity", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁The", "▁", "2", "5", "-", "year", "-", "old"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.16113346815109253, -2.622600959512056e-06, 0.0, -0.5114278793334961, -0.006931426469236612, -0.00032205163734033704, -0.002145728562027216, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -0.08819950371980667, -0.0015548295341432095, -0.5314406156539917, -0.06338243186473846, 0.0, 0.0, -0.02325674518942833, -0.052879028022289276, -0.09741927683353424, 0.0, -0.0012732979375869036, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.17306871712207794, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -3.123234637314454e-05, -0.20275166630744934, -0.08159243315458298, -1.597391747054644e-05, 0.0, 0.0, -0.023301932960748672, 0.0, -0.0023748071398586035, 0.0, -0.0008387623238377273, -0.2529177963733673, 0.0, -0.0019482456846162677, 0.0, -0.34870174527168274, 0.0, 0.0, -0.02324579656124115, -2.992108420585282e-05, -0.7057934403419495, -5.602820692729438e-06, -0.00010442188795423135, -0.010169005021452904, -0.0019953595474362373, 0.0, -4.768370445162873e-07, -0.0020202244631946087, -0.12603715062141418, -0.6487444639205933, -0.41979774832725525, -3.576278118089249e-07, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": -0.010169005021452904, "The": -0.16113346815109253, "▁Wel": -2.622600959512056e-06, "sh": 0.0, "▁government": -0.5114278793334961, "▁has": -0.006931426469236612, "▁announced": -0.00032205163734033704, "▁plans": -0.002145728562027216, "▁to": -0.2529177963733673, "▁sell": -0.08819950371980667, "▁off": -0.0015548295341432095, "▁the": -0.20275166630744934, "▁country": -0.06338243186473846, "'": 0.0, "s": 0.0, "▁historic": -0.02325674518942833, "▁mon": -0.052879028022289276, "oc": -0.09741927683353424, "le": 0.0, "▁and": -0.0012732979375869036, "▁x": 0.0, "y": 0.0, "lo": 0.0, "phone": 0.0, "▁used": -0.17306871712207794, "▁by": 0.0, "▁Sir": 0.0, "▁Patrick": 0.0, "▁Moore": 0.0, ",": -0.0008387623238377273, "▁former": -0.08159243315458298, "▁present": -1.597391747054644e-05, "er": 0.0, "▁of": 0.0, "▁The": -0.0020202244631946087, "▁Sky": 0.0, "▁At": -0.0023748071398586035, "▁Night": 0.0, "▁raise": 0.0, "▁funds": -0.0019482456846162677, "▁for": 0.0, "▁char": -0.34870174527168274, "ity": 0.0, ".": 0.0, "##": -0.7057934403419495, "#": -5.602820692729438e-06, "Art": -0.0019953595474362373, "icle": 0.0, ":": -4.768370445162873e-07, "▁": -0.12603715062141418, "2": -0.6487444639205933, "5": -0.41979774832725525, "-": 0.0, "year": 0.0, "old": 0.0}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

The dog, a one-year-old Australian sheepdog named Poppy, went with her. Police confirmed that Poppy's barking alerted rescuers to the whereabouts of the pair after a seven-hour search. Rescuers found Sophia and Poppy 200m from a dam on the family's property. The Australian Broadcasting Corp. quoted Sophia's grandmother, Vera Cook, who credited the dog with saving the toddler's life. She said that Sophia was wearing just a nappy and T-shirt when she wandered off. \"The only thing I was thinking was well, hopefully the dog would have kept her warm,\" Ms Cook was quoted as saying. \"If [the dog] wasn't with her, I don't know whether they would have found her.\" The family issued a statement thanking emergency services and promising that Poppy would be \"well fed this evening\".\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\nA pet dog is being credited with keeping a little girl safe after the pair wandered away from their family home and could not be found for hours.\n\n###\nArticle: The petition calls on the EU and its member states to stop the talks on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership or TTIP. It also says they should not ratify a similar deal that has already been done between the EU and Canada. It says some aspects pose a threat to democracy and the rule of law. One of the concerns mentioned in the petition is the idea of tribunals that foreign investors would be able to use in some circumstances to sue governments. There is a great deal of controversy over exactly what this system, known as Investor State Dispute Settlement, would enable companies to do, but campaigners see it as an opportunity for international business to get compensation for government policy changes that adversely affect them. This kind of provision exists in many bilateral trade and investment agreements. Friends of the Earth have published new research on the impact they have had on EU countries. Information about these cases is not always made public, but the group says that going back to 1994, foreign investors have sought compensation of almost €30bn (£24bn) from 20 states. Where the results are known (a small minority of the total), the tribunals have awarded total compensation of €3.5bn (about £2.8bn). In Britain, the possible implications of this provision for the National Health Service have been especially controversial. Campaigners believe that the investor tribunals would make it harder to reverse any decisions to contract services out to international healthcare firms. John Hilary of War on Want said: TTIP \"will make it impossible for any future government to repeal the Health & Social Care Act and bring the NHS back into public hands\". The petition lists a number of other areas where its signatories believes European standards would suffer if the TTIP negotiations are completed and the Canada deal is ratified: employment, social, environmental, privacy and consumer protection. The European Commission says the EU will not have to sacrifice its high standards. It also says investor protection provisions are important for investment flows and have in general worked well. But it accepts there is a need for improvement and is trying to achieve that in its bilateral negotiations. The petition has been organised as an exercise called a European Citizens' Initiative which can lead to a public hearing in the European Parliament and require the European Commission to give a formal response explaining why it is accepting or rejecting what the petitioners call for. The European Commission has already said that the petition doesn't qualify as such an Initiative. Campaigners have launched a legal challenge to this decision.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nCampaigners have launched a petition calling on the EU to stop talks on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) deal with Canada, claiming it could threaten democracy and undermine standards.\n\n\nPlease let me know if you need an", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "C", "amp", "aign", "ers", "▁have", "▁launched", "▁a", "▁pet", "ition", "▁calling", "▁on", "▁the", "▁EU", "▁to", "▁stop", "▁tal", "ks", "▁on", "▁the", "▁Trans", "at", "l", "antic", "▁Trade", "▁and", "▁In", "vest", "ment", "▁Part", "ners", "hip", "▁(", "TT", "IP", ")", "▁deal", "▁with", "▁Canada", ",", "▁claim", "ing", "▁it", "▁could", "▁threaten", "▁dem", "ocracy", "▁and", "▁und", "erm", "ine", "▁standards", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "Please", "▁let", "▁me", "▁know", "▁if", "▁you", "▁need", "▁any"], "token_logprobs": [-1.1920928244535389e-07, -0.03680572286248207, -0.00015841660206206143, -2.992108420585282e-05, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -0.00803417433053255, -0.010337145999073982, -0.00015841660206206143, -0.05274356156587601, -2.50339189733495e-06, -0.008528714068233967, -0.2519296109676361, 0.0, -0.052700474858284, -0.008264390751719475, -0.01642504148185253, -0.6002594232559204, 0.0, -0.0001641377166379243, -0.36094364523887634, -0.001576134585775435, -4.6491513785440475e-06, -6.961580220377073e-05, 0.0, 0.0, -2.7418097943154862e-06, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -2.3841855067985307e-07, -7.152555099310121e-07, -0.3615717887878418, -5.960462772236497e-07, 0.0, -0.006716059520840645, -0.7536370754241943, -0.00964209996163845, -2.992108420585282e-05, -0.034584395587444305, -0.513802170753479, 0.0, -0.0015488782664760947, -0.41715317964553833, -0.8038402199745178, -1.1801649634435307e-05, -0.003197915619239211, -0.0008491248008795083, -0.2755620777606964, 0.0, 0.0, -1.8954096958623268e-05, -9.65590606938349e-06, -0.09663871675729752, -1.9907753085135482e-05, -0.028189824894070625, -0.05948416143655777, -0.0005382042727433145, 0.0, 0.0, -0.00015841660206206143, -0.006732044741511345, -0.01086580753326416, -0.010954008437693119], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": -0.028189824894070625, "C": -0.03680572286248207, "amp": -0.00015841660206206143, "aign": -2.992108420585282e-05, "ers": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "▁have": -0.00803417433053255, "▁launched": -0.010337145999073982, "▁a": -0.00015841660206206143, "▁pet": -0.05274356156587601, "ition": -2.50339189733495e-06, "▁calling": -0.008528714068233967, "▁on": -0.0001641377166379243, "▁the": -0.36094364523887634, "▁EU": -0.052700474858284, "▁to": -0.008264390751719475, "▁stop": -0.01642504148185253, "▁tal": -0.6002594232559204, "ks": 0.0, "▁Trans": -0.001576134585775435, "at": -4.6491513785440475e-06, "l": -6.961580220377073e-05, "antic": 0.0, "▁Trade": 0.0, "▁and": -0.0008491248008795083, "▁In": 0.0, "vest": 0.0, "ment": 0.0, "▁Part": 0.0, "ners": -2.3841855067985307e-07, "hip": -7.152555099310121e-07, "▁(": -0.3615717887878418, "TT": -5.960462772236497e-07, "IP": 0.0, ")": -0.006716059520840645, "▁deal": -0.7536370754241943, "▁with": -0.00964209996163845, "▁Canada": -2.992108420585282e-05, ",": -0.034584395587444305, "▁claim": -0.513802170753479, "ing": 0.0, "▁it": -0.0015488782664760947, "▁could": -0.41715317964553833, "▁threaten": -0.8038402199745178, "▁dem": -1.1801649634435307e-05, "ocracy": -0.003197915619239211, "▁und": -0.2755620777606964, "erm": 0.0, "ine": 0.0, "▁standards": -1.8954096958623268e-05, ".": -9.65590606938349e-06, "Please": -0.05948416143655777, "▁let": -0.0005382042727433145, "▁me": 0.0, "▁know": 0.0, "▁if": -0.00015841660206206143, "▁you": -0.006732044741511345, "▁need": -0.01086580753326416, "▁any": -0.010954008437693119}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

Some 20 courses have now been cancelled while authorities investigate. About 90 would-be students have been refunded. College director Haji Yunis told the BBC he was co-operating with inquiries. Secretly filmed footage had showed Mr Yunis laughing about the scam he presided over. He told the researcher that for Â£1,200 he would \"bring you in the back door\" and \"fast track\" him to a bodyguard qualification without any training. Mr Yunis told the researcher not to worry about the police. Fraudulent use of SIA cards in fact carries a maximum six-month prison sentence. Both the exam board whose certification was fraudulently obtained, Industry Qualifications (IQ), and the Security Industry Authority (SIA) are investigating the college. An audit is currently taking place, with the aim of ascertaining how many qualifications awarded at the college to enable security guards to become licensed by the SIA were bogus. Jobseekers must sit mandatory exams to get an SIA card. A statement placed on Ashley Commerce College's website by IQ read: \"Following the BBC broadcast, IQ has been working with the regulators Ofqual and the SIA to formulate a plan for identifying learners affected by the fraud. \"We do expect to find evidence that some learners have received their qualifications without having done their course or tests properly. These qualifications will be reviewed. \"We know that this will leave many learners who attended ACC worried about the authenticity of their qualifications and IQ is working hard to find out how many learners may be affected.\" The statement said every student who obtained an SIA licence through the college may be affected. The college has been operating since 2010. The statement added: \"Where we cannot guarantee that a qualification has not been affected by fraud, we are required to remove the qualification immediately and notify the Security Industry Authority.\" Mr Yunis would not say how many students' qualifications were now being reviewed. Keith Vaz MP, the chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, called the fraud a \"major scandal\".
