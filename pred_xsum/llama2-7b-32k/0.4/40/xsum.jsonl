Rescuers found Sophia and Poppy 200m from a dam on the family's property. The Australian Broadcasting Corp. quoted Sophia's grandmother, Vera Cook, who credited the dog with saving the toddler's life. She said that Sophia was wearing just a nappy and T-shirt when she wandered off. \"The only thing I was thinking was well, hopefully the dog would have kept her warm,\" Ms Cook was quoted as saying. \"If [the dog] wasn't with her, I don't know whether they would have found her.\" The family issued a statement thanking emergency services and promising that Poppy would be \"well fed this evening\".\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\nA pet dog is being credited with keeping a little girl safe after the pair wandered away from their family home and could not be found for hours.\n\n###\nArticle: Head coach Stuart Lancaster's World Cup preparations suffered a blow as for the first 70 minutes a largely first-choice XV struggled to deal with French power. Two late tries flattered the visitors, who have one game left before launching their World Cup campaign against Fiji on 18 September. \"We gave away penalties and our discipline was shocking,\" said Robshaw. \"Whether it was rust, or nerves, it wasn't good enough. Credit to France, they put us under pressure and made us make mistakes. \"We gave too many penalties away, but in the second half we came out and played well but couldn't quite get over the line in the end,\" he told Sky Sports. \"We can't give teams like France and other quality sides head starts like we did. \"We'll look long and hard at ourselves, because we let ourselves down in the first half. We played well in phases but you can't wait for 40 minutes to do that.\" Late tries from Danny Cipriani and Jonathan Joseph made it close on the scoreboard but Lancaster was left with much to ponder by a disappointing team display in the Stade de France. Media playback is not supported on this device The head coach, who must announce his final squad by 31 August, added: \"We've got to get our discipline at the breakdown - we can't give France easy position like we did. We need to improve on that, because all the little mistakes add up. \"The bench made a difference. It upped the energy levels and we scored some good tries. I won't gloss over what went on before that, because it was too little too late. \"There are a few players who have given me food for thought, those guys who came on and gave us the energy we needed and made a difference. \"I need to have a sleep on this game and think about my final squad. We're two weeks away from playing Ireland and four weeks away from Fiji in the World Cup and we'll expect a reaction next time.\" England host Ireland in their final World Cup warm-up game at Twickenham on 5 September. Fly-half Ford told Sky Sports: \"I thought we might snatch that at the end but we had hardly any ball in the first half and gave away too many penalties. We played some good stuff in the second-half. \"In the first half a lot of our undoing was down to ourselves. We just weren't good enough in that first half and there's no excuse for that. We let them build up the score and that made it hard for us. \"It was frustrating and we had to think of ways to adapt and that was constantly going through our minds.

Denmark's Soren Kjeldsen (68) and American Keegan Bradley (68) are three shots off the lead, two clear of defending champion Zach Johnson (70). Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy shot 71 in the worst of the weather to finish eight shots off the pace.

Meanwhile, Germany's two-time major winner Martin Kaymer got to seven under but triple bogeyed the 10th and finished with a 73 for three under. The wind blew harder and the rain fell heavier after Mickelson reached the safety of the clubhouse, destroying the chances of a host of big names. World number three Jordan Spieth shot a 75 to finish right on four-over-par and just make the cut, as did England's Masters champion Danny Willett, Northern Ireland's Graeme McDowell, and Scottish duo Colin Montgomerie and Paul Lawrie. England's former US Open champion Justin Rose shot a 77 to finish three over, while world number one Jason Day battled to a 70 to finish one over.

The five-time major winner told BBC Sport: \"If I look back to my mid-30s, I am 35lbs lighter, in better shape than I was and can manage the symptoms of my psoriatic arthritis. I feel stronger and in a better condition than I have ever been. \"I can't see why I can't play my best golf in the coming years. I am optimistic about this week and the coming years and the opportunities to add to my resume.\" Mickelson teed off in overcast but benign conditions and covered the front nine in 33 shots, very nearly acing the eighth hole. It started to rain when he hit the turn and he dropped his first shot of the tournament at the par-four 12th, but ground things out as others wilted.

After all, Ringrose wears the number 13, played for Blackrock, UCD, Leinster and didn't start his rugby career as a centre. But the 22-year-old new kid on the block appears destined to make a name for himself and his entry into the Six Nations fray is keenly anticipated. Ireland coach Joe Schmidt was careful not to throw Ringrose into the international arena too early. But the emerging player is regarded as a young man with a mature head in his shoulders, someone well equipped to handle hype and huge media attention. But, what makes him so special? What are the qualities that had O'Driscoll himself calling for the Leinster lad to be included in Ireland's last Six Nations campaign? \"He has been anointed the next Brian O'Driscoll. Brian was similar at that age, efficient and solid,\" says Eddie O'Sullivan, Ireland's coach from 2001 to 2008. \"Garry's trademark is he is incredibly efficient. Young players make bloopers, but he doesn't make mistakes. It's important to remain calm under pressure and then when your opportunity comes, you take it. \"Brian didn't make mistakes and then he stepped up. No-one expected him to score a try in Paris in 2000, but he scored three. \"Then no-one expected him to score that try against Australia for the Lions a year later, but he did. These are the moments. They came to him and he took them. Then he kicked on, kept improving.\" Ringrose made his senior Ireland debut in the autumn international against Canada last November, a week after being an unused replacement in that historic win over the All Blacks in Chicago. He then scored his first international try in the exciting 27-24 win over Australia in Dublin. Ringrose played his school rugby for Blackrock College in Dublin, although when he joined the senior side, he wasn't seen as one of their better players. Hopping from number nine to 15 and not being offered a permanent position, he kept his head down and eventually an injury opened up a spot at 13. After the switch, he remained their kicker and his points tally propelled Blackrock to the Leinster Senior Cup. Suddenly people were asking who this guy was and he was off to UCD with a glowing reputation. Bobby Byrne, the Director of Rugby at UCD, recalls: \"I first came across Gary in that run to the Senior Cup. He wasn't overly recognised at that stage but suddenly he was having a significant impact for the team. He is the player I am most looking forward to seeing in this year's Six Nations. \"He had composure, was an elusive runner and was really courageous. He hadn't the biggest frame, but he had a good bit of pace to finish off. \"He had, and still has, a great temperament. He is a very balanced guy. The rate of improvement since he has left school has been phenomenal. \"He has improved every year and he's conscious that he always needs to improve, so his\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nA young Irish rugby player is being compared to the legendary Brian O'Driscoll.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "A", "▁young", "▁Irish", "▁rugby", "▁player", "▁is", "▁being", "▁compared", "▁to", "▁the", "▁legend", "ary", "▁Brian", "▁O", "'", "D", "ris", "coll", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁The", "▁", "1", "9", "9", "4", "▁film", "▁Pr", "êt", "-", "à", "-", "▁Por", "ter", "▁was", "▁a", "▁sat", "ire", "▁of", "▁the", "▁fashion", "▁industry", ",", "▁but", "▁it", "▁also", "▁had", "▁a", "▁lot", "▁to", "▁say", "▁about", "▁the", "▁world", "▁of", "▁celebr"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.21695657074451447, -0.3688569962978363, -0.023273982107639313, -0.18020020425319672, -0.023318005725741386, -0.0215834341943264, -0.0009450022480450571, -0.0825696811079979, -0.00010740180005086586, -0.07667405158281326, -0.015389974229037762, 0.0, -0.00019429226813372225, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.21031711995601654, -0.538145124912262, 0.0, -9.179073458653875e-06, 0.0, 0.0, -2.50339189733495e-06, 0.0, 0.0, -0.04146536439657211, -0.06437785178422928, -0.06060195714235306, -0.1573300063610077, -0.7447078824043274, -1.2195550203323364, -0.5546302795410156, -0.0002466136065777391, 0.0, -0.3138042688369751, -4.768370445162873e-07, -0.17300905287265778, -0.00010442188795423135, 0.0, -0.9851771593093872, -0.030471062287688255, -0.0587325394153595, -0.03505263105034828, -0.527729332447052, -3.2186455882765586e-06, -0.00010799778101500124, -0.11744442582130432, -0.24567927420139313, -0.3636102080345154, -0.09209223091602325, -0.07996208220720291, -0.9580354690551758, -0.013253096491098404, -0.17974445223808289, -0.0012725834967568517, 0.0, 0.0, -7.402622577501461e-05, -0.3457055687904358, -1.5616295058862306e-05, -1.0146474838256836], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "A": -0.21695657074451447, "▁young": -0.3688569962978363, "▁Irish": -0.023273982107639313, "▁rugby": -0.18020020425319672, "▁player": -0.023318005725741386, "▁is": -0.0215834341943264, "▁being": -0.0009450022480450571, "▁compared": -0.0825696811079979, "▁to": -0.0012725834967568517, "▁the": -7.402622577501461e-05, "▁legend": -0.015389974229037762, "ary": 0.0, "▁Brian": -0.00019429226813372225, "▁O": 0.0, "'": 0.0, "D": 0.0, "ris": 0.0, "coll": 0.0, ".": -0.21031711995601654, "##": -9.179073458653875e-06, "#": 0.0, "Art": -2.50339189733495e-06, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "▁The": -0.04146536439657211, "▁": -0.06437785178422928, "1": -0.06060195714235306, "9": -0.7447078824043274, "4": -1.2195550203323364, "▁film": -0.5546302795410156, "▁Pr": -0.0002466136065777391, "êt": 0.0, "-": -0.17300905287265778, "à": -4.768370445162873e-07, "▁Por": -0.00010442188795423135, "ter": 0.0, "▁was": -0.9851771593093872, "▁a": -0.013253096491098404, "▁sat": -0.0587325394153595, "ire": -0.03505263105034828, "▁of": -1.5616295058862306e-05, "▁fashion": -0.00010799778101500124, "▁industry": -0.11744442582130432, ",": -0.24567927420139313, "▁but": -0.3636102080345154, "▁it": -0.09209223091602325, "▁also": -0.07996208220720291, "▁had": -0.9580354690551758, "▁lot": -0.17974445223808289, "▁say": 0.0, "▁about": 0.0, "▁world": -0.3457055687904358, "▁celebr": -1.0146474838256836}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

He is favoured by many conservatives who consider him to espouse a similarly strict interpretation of law as Scalia. Judge Gorsuch was first nominated to the 10th US Circuit Court of Appeals by former President George W Bush in 2006. Judge Gorsuch began his law career clerking for Supreme Court Justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy, the latter of whom he could now serve alongside. He worked in a private law practice in Washington for a decade and served as the principal deputy assistant associate attorney general at the Justice Department under the Bush administration. Judge Gorsuch graduated from Columbia University and Harvard Law School, where former President Barack Obama was a classmate, and earned a doctorate in legal philosophy at Oxford University. Perhaps it was during his time in England that he accumulated what his former law partner, Mark Hansen, has said was \"an inexhaustible store\" of Winston Churchill quotes. Judge Gorsuch - who reportedly likes to fly-fish and hunt - lives in Boulder with his wife Louise and two daughters, where he is also an adjunct law professor at the University of Colorado. If confirmed by the Senate, he would become the only Protestant on the current bench. The other justices are Jewish and Catholic. His family is well-connected in Republican establishment politics. His mother, Anne Gorsuch Burford, was the first female director of the Environmental Protection Agency during the Reagan administration. He is known for his clear and concise writing style, navigating the most complex legal issues as deftly as the double-black diamond slopes on which he is reputedly an expert skier in the snow-capped mountain state he calls home. Judge Gorsuch's published writings reveal his conservative leanings. He argued against euthanasia in his 2006 book The Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia. \"All human beings are intrinsically valuable and the intentional taking of human life by private persons is always wrong,\" he wrote. In a 2005 article in the National Review, Judge Gorsuch argued that \"American liberals have become addicted to the courtroom\". He said they keep \"relying on judges and lawyers rather than elected leaders and the ballot box, as the primary means of effecting their social agenda\". Judge Gorsuch has never ruled on abortion, and he is not expected to call into question high-profile rulings on that issue or gay marriage. His conservative outlook cements Mr Trump's campaign promise to nominate a judge \"in the mould\" of Justice Scalia, restoring the nine-seat high court's 5-4 conservative majority. Much like the late Scalia, the Ivy-League educated judge is known to support textualism, or the interpretation of law according to its plain text. He also maintains a strict interpretation of the US Constitution, or how it was originally understood by the Founding Fathers. While sitting on the bench of the 10th Circuit, Judge Gorsuch sided with groups that successfully challenged the Obama administration's requirements for employers to provide health insurance that includes contraception in the Hobby Lobby Stores\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nPresident Trump has nominated Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, where he is expected to be confirmed.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "Pres", "ident", "▁Trump", "▁has", "▁nominated", "▁Neil", "▁G", "ors", "uch", "▁to", "▁the", "▁Supreme", "▁Court", ",", "▁where", "▁he", "▁is", "▁expected", "▁to", "▁be", "▁confirmed", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁The", "▁", "4", "9", "▁-", "▁year", "▁-", "▁old", "▁Colorado", "▁native", ",", "▁whose", "▁legal", "▁pedig", "ree", "▁includes", "▁Harvard", "▁and", "▁Oxford", ",", "▁would", "▁succeed", "▁the", "▁late", "▁Justice", "▁Anton", "in", "▁S", "cal", "ia", "▁if", "▁confirmed", "."], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.26882636547088623, 0.0, -0.36088407039642334, -0.12204417586326599, -0.00012027494085486978, -0.003442197572439909, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.6935738325119019, -0.530518651008606, -0.03507990762591362, 0.0, -0.5127373933792114, -0.5127609372138977, -0.17349594831466675, -0.7123172879219055, -0.0025018127635121346, 0.0, -0.06139657646417618, -0.027775410562753677, -0.4417344331741333, -0.3852307200431824, 0.0, -0.0005606033373624086, 0.0, 0.0, -3.576278118089249e-07, 0.0, 0.0, -0.04653611406683922, -0.009771019220352173, -0.5887353420257568, -0.004134441260248423, -0.6931570768356323, 0.0, -1.6689286894688848e-06, 0.0, -0.00025602878304198384, 0.0, -9.83428253675811e-05, -3.6954811548639555e-06, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -1.1920928244535389e-07, 0.0, 0.0, -1.1920928244535389e-07, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -1.1920928244535389e-07, 0.0, -0.00036459474358707666], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "Pres": -0.26882636547088623, "ident": 0.0, "▁Trump": -0.36088407039642334, "▁has": -0.12204417586326599, "▁nominated": -0.00012027494085486978, "▁Neil": -0.003442197572439909, "▁G": 0.0, "ors": 0.0, "uch": 0.0, "▁to": 0.0, "▁the": 0.0, "▁Supreme": -0.03507990762591362, "▁Court": 0.0, ",": 0.0, "▁where": -0.5127609372138977, "▁he": -0.17349594831466675, "▁is": -0.7123172879219055, "▁expected": -0.0025018127635121346, "▁be": -0.06139657646417618, "▁confirmed": 0.0, ".": -0.00036459474358707666, "##": -0.0005606033373624086, "#": 0.0, "Art": -3.576278118089249e-07, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "▁The": -0.04653611406683922, "▁": -0.009771019220352173, "4": -0.5887353420257568, "9": -0.004134441260248423, "▁-": -1.6689286894688848e-06, "▁year": 0.0, "▁old": 0.0, "▁Colorado": -0.00025602878304198384, "▁native": 0.0, "▁whose": -3.6954811548639555e-06, "▁legal": 0.0, "▁pedig": 0.0, "ree": 0.0, "▁includes": 0.0, "▁Harvard": 0.0, "▁and": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "▁Oxford": 0.0, "▁would": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "▁succeed": 0.0, "▁late": 0.0, "▁Justice": 0.0, "▁Anton": 0.0, "in": 0.0, "▁S": 0.0, "cal": 0.0, "ia": 0.0, "▁if": -1.1920928244535389e-07}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

By the end of the 80s, the graffiti culture was being forced to adapt, as by then, New York's Transit Authority had brought in procedures that made it tougher to gain access to the train yards. New models with coatings that were resistant to paint, and faster cleaning of any that were covered in graffiti also meant the artists' work was short-lived and the thrill of seeing the work trundling around the city was lost. In the years since, some of the artists have fared well in the US and Europe, others have spent time in prison, one has become a policeman and some have died. The art itself is now part of the mainstream, no longer reserved for city walls but a regular part of a designer's armoury. For Cooper, the graffiti work is an important part of her time in New York, producing the images she is most proud of, rather than those shot on assignment for newspapers or magazines. At times, she would spend hours waiting and watching, for that moment when good light combined with a powerful piece of art passing through an interesting part of the city. Chalfant approached the graffiti from a different angle, concentrating on the work itself, often shooting a series of overlapping images using the motor drive on his camera.

In February, a consignment of beef being stored at Freeza Meats was found to contain horsemeat. It did not belong to Freeza Meats and none of their products tested positive for horsemeat. Mr Fairburn, who is now retired, said the beef belonged to another company, McAdam Foods, and that his firm has suffered. He told MPs the scandal had led to his firm missing out on multi-million pound orders and had resulted in 31 jobs being lost in Newry. Quizzed by MPs on the Environment and Rural Affairs Committee about the horsemeat scandal, Mr Fairburn described it as a \"fraud\" and said it was \"being perpetrated by a big organisation\". He also said he suspected it had been \"going on for some time\". He told MPs that the illegal meat trade originated in other parts of Europe and did not come from the UK or Ireland. He rejected a suggestion from the Conservative MP Anne McIntosh that \"all roads lead to Ireland\". Asked if the scandal originated in Ireland, Mr Fairburn said \"not at all\". Mr Fairburn faced questioning from Conservative and Labour MPs and the South Down SDLP MP Margaret Ritchie. MPs also heard evidence from the Food Standards Agency. Tests carried out on the meat stored at Freeza Meats found that samples from the consignment contained about 80% horsemeat. It followed the discovery of horse DNA at a plant in the Republic of Ireland. Newry and Mourne Council confirmed that tests on Freeza Meats' burgers were free from horsemeat DNA. Martin McAdam, whose firm owned the contaminated meat, said there was \"clearly an issue\" with their Polish supplier.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nA former boss of a company that was at the centre of the horsemeat scandal has given evidence to a Westminster committee .  \n\nArticle: \n  \n\nJames Fairburn, who is now retired, said the beef belonged to another company, McAdam Food", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "A", "▁former", "▁b", "oss", "▁of", "▁a", "▁company", "▁that", "▁was", "▁at", "▁the", "▁centre", "▁of", "▁the", "▁hors", "eme", "at", "▁sc", "andal", "▁has", "▁given", "▁evidence", "▁to", "▁a", "▁West", "min", "ster", "▁committee", "▁.", "▁▁", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁", "<0x0A>", "▁▁", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "James", "▁Fair", "burn", ",", "▁who", "▁is", "▁now", "▁retired", ",", "▁said", "▁the", "▁be", "ef", "▁belonged", "▁to", "▁another", "▁company", ",", "▁Mc", "Ad", "am", "▁Food", "s"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.015898607671260834, -0.01785842701792717, -0.6800141930580139, 0.0, -0.004598874598741531, -0.0003496989083942026, -0.8718956708908081, -0.4598631262779236, -0.27869749069213867, -0.5774251818656921, 0.0, -0.0069540380500257015, 0.0, -0.006715940777212381, -0.00015901254664640874, 0.0, 0.0, -2.3841855067985307e-07, -4.768370445162873e-07, -0.07485227286815643, -0.8332154750823975, 0.0, -1.2159273865108844e-05, -0.0037664680276066065, -0.005512631498277187, -2.50339189733495e-06, 0.0, -0.000377583724912256, -0.5080155730247498, -0.049997150897979736, 0.0, 0.0, -0.04581659659743309, 0.0, -0.00016711745411157608, -1.4305012882687151e-05, -0.23057928681373596, -0.0067961025051772594, 0.0, -0.1786639392375946, -0.299703449010849, 0.0, 0.0, -0.36192813515663147, -0.06104975938796997, -0.008804429322481155, -0.0005529781919904053, 0.0, -2.3841855067985307e-07, -0.32370299100875854, -3.516612196108326e-05, -0.0003887851198669523, 0.0, -1.4781842764932662e-05, 0.0, -3.576278118089249e-07, -1.1920928244535389e-07, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": -0.1786639392375946, "A": -0.015898607671260834, "▁former": -0.01785842701792717, "▁b": -0.6800141930580139, "oss": 0.0, "▁of": 0.0, "▁a": -0.0037664680276066065, "▁company": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "▁that": -0.4598631262779236, "▁was": -0.27869749069213867, "▁at": -0.5774251818656921, "▁the": -3.516612196108326e-05, "▁centre": -0.0069540380500257015, "▁hors": -0.00015901254664640874, "eme": 0.0, "at": 0.0, "▁sc": -2.3841855067985307e-07, "andal": -4.768370445162873e-07, "▁has": -0.07485227286815643, "▁given": -0.8332154750823975, "▁evidence": 0.0, "▁to": 0.0, "▁West": -0.005512631498277187, "min": -2.50339189733495e-06, "ster": 0.0, "▁committee": -0.000377583724912256, "▁.": -0.5080155730247498, "▁▁": -0.0067961025051772594, "Art": -0.04581659659743309, "icle": 0.0, ":": -0.00016711745411157608, "▁": -1.4305012882687151e-05, "James": -0.299703449010849, "▁Fair": 0.0, "burn": 0.0, ",": 0.0, "▁who": -0.06104975938796997, "▁is": -0.008804429322481155, "▁now": -0.0005529781919904053, "▁retired": 0.0, "▁said": -0.32370299100875854, "▁be": -0.0003887851198669523, "ef": 0.0, "▁belonged": -1.4781842764932662e-05, "▁another": -3.576278118089249e-07, "▁Mc": 0.0, "Ad": 0.0, "am": 0.0, "▁Food": 0.0, "s": 0.0}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

Internet companies will also be required to allow Russian authorities access to users' information. One human rights group called the move \"draconian\". The law was approved by Russia's upper house of parliament in April. It includes measures to ensure that bloggers cannot remain anonymous, and states that social networks must maintain six months of data on its users. The information must be stored on servers based in Russian territory, so that government authorities can gain access. Critics see it as the latest in a series of recent moves to curb internet freedom. Hugh Williamson, of New York-based Human Rights Watch, has called the law \"another milestone in Russia's relentless crackdown on free expression\". \"The internet is the last island of free expression in Russia and these draconian regulations are clearly aimed at putting it under government control,\" he added. Opposition figures have used the internet to air their views, with some gaining millions of followers. Commentators opposing Vladimir Putin often face restrictions in broadcast outlets and newspapers. Analysis: Famil Ismailov, news editor, BBCRussian.com Russian bloggers are bracing themselves for the moment when Russia's new \"information security law\" comes into force on 1 August. Some already share advice on how to use proxy servers in order to access social media sites that, in their view, are under threat of being closed. It is hard to see how the law will be enforced. The servers for most of the popular social media platforms that many Russians use are based outside Russia. Many popular bloggers are already looking for, and apparently finding, ways to \"cheat\" the feature that counts page visits and keep their daily unique visitor numbers just under 3000, or to make sure that the statistics are hidden altogether. Anton Nossik, who is considered Russia's \"internet guru\", wrote in his LiveJournal blog that the new law didn't threaten individual bloggers directly, but provided legal grounds to block popular social networks like Facebook, Twitter, LiveJournal and Google. \"The issue of banning all these platforms in Russia is a political one and it will be decided by only one person\", Mr Nossik wrote, with a thinly veiled reference to President Vladimir Putin. Earlier in the year, Russia enacted a law that gave the government powers to block websites without explanation. In March, Moscow blocked the blog of Mr Navalny, along with two news sites and a organisation run by Garry Kasparov - a vocal critic of the Russian government. In a statement, Russia's prosecutor general's office said the blocks were imposed because of the sites' role in helping stage illegal protests. Earlier this week, Twitter blocked access to an anti-Kremlin account that often publishes leaked government documents, following a request by Russia's federal communications agency Roskomnadzor. For many years, Russia had relatively lax internet laws. However Moscow has recently changed its tune, with Mr Putin branding the internet an ongoing \"CIA project\".

It is the latest in a string of recalls by the carmaker. Toyota has already recalled some 10 million cars globally that were fitted with faulty air bags linked to a number of deaths. The defective window switch affects models including the Yaris model as well as the Corolla, Camry, RAV4, Highlander and others. The recall only affects cars produced between 2005 and 2010. Of the total, about 2.7 million cars were sold in North America, 1.2 million in Europe, and 600,000 in Japan, the company said. The firm explained that modules in a switch related to the electric window might have been lubricated inconsistently during manufacturing. Debris caused by wear from the electrical contact points can accumulate and cause a short-circuit. This could in turn cause the switch to overheat and melt, potentially leading to a fire.

Their combined scores helped them finish ahead of Italy and Germany. Olympic champion Laura Asadauskaite claimed the women's European gold. Asadauskaite, who started the run-shoot a combined 59 seconds behind eventual silver medallist Elodie Clouvel of France, had already secured her place in Rio by winning the World Cup final in June. It meant ninth-placed Alice Sotero of Italy was also rewarded with an Olympic berth in a race which saw Germany's Lena Schoneborn take bronze at the University of Bath. French was delighted by her career-best result which secured Britain their third Olympic place - following Joe Choong's seventh place in the men's event on Saturday and Murray's fifth at the 2015 World Championships. \"It's amazing, I never thought I would be able to do it,\" French told BBC Sport. \"I thought I was pretty average all day to be honest, but held it together in the run-shoot at the end and now I just have to stay strong next year.\" Murray - the silver medallist at London 2012 and 2014 World champion - was expected to challenge for her first European title. She ranked second after the swimming and fourth after the fencing stages, but dropped to ninth after the showjumping round and struggling with her shooting in the final event. \"There was a lot of pressure,\" Murray admitted to BBC Sport. \"I've had a difficult year with some injuries and some personal things going on so hopefully next season will be a fresh start.

The prize was Europe's biggest ever and was capped after a series of rollovers. On the night of the draw Chris was checking their numbers on the BBC's Red Button digital text service about midnight on the television in their bedroom. \"I started circling the numbers I had matched but wasn't doing very well. Then on the fifth line, all the circles seemed to join up.\" The telephone line run by Camelot for claims was closed. Chris and husband Colin sat up all night they were so excited. \"When we first realised we had won, it felt like a dream,\" Colin said. \"Everything went into slow motion.\" Life changing When asked at a media conference in Falkirk what they will do with the money, Chris said: \"We're not flashy people.\" \"The next steps are going to be the most difficult... with great wealth comes great responsibility,\" added Colin. The Weirs have both had serious health conditions in recent years and have not been able to work. Colin, 64, had previously worked as a television cameraman and Chris, 55, is a fully-trained psychiatric nurse. The most exciting aspect of their windfall is the opportunity to travel. \"We have both always wanted to see the Great Wall of China and Colin would love to stand at the foot of Ayers Rock in Australia,\" said Chris. \"We also love art galleries, so this gives us the chance to visit those in Paris and in Russia. These are all things we thought we would never see.\" They have also already decided to buy homes for their two children, Carly and Jamie (both in their 20s). UK winning streak Before Tuesday's draw, the largest lottery winner in the UK was the player who claimed £113m in the Euromillions last October and chose to remain anonymous. The couple have displaced former postal worker Angela Kelly from East Kilbride, who became Scotland's biggest winner in August 2007 when she scooped £35,425,411.80 in the Euromillions jackpot. Britons have banked the Euromillions jackpot more than 14 times in the last two years. Last year, two anonymous UK winners scooped £113m and £84m. And Nigel and Justine Page, from Gloucestershire, won the £56m jackpot prize on EuroMillions in February 2010. National Lottery operator Camelot runs the Euromillions draw in the UK and has also had the same role for the weekly Lotto draw since it was launched in 1994. The firm says that its draws have created about 2,400 lottery millionaires in the UK in the intervening 17 years. If the winner of Tuesday's draw had been a single player, he or she would instantly have been placed 430th in this year's Sunday Times Rich List just above Scottish businessman Sir Angus Grossart and Irina Abramovich, the former wife of Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich.

Rebecca Hilsenrath, head of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, said the remarks were \"truly disgusting\" as well as unlawful. Mr Wilson said it was \"not a colour issue\" but an \"economic judgement\". Speaking to BBC Asian Network, Mr Wilson, who has amassed nearly 1,000 buy-to-let properties in Kent, said a property he had bought from an Indian couple cost him about Â£12,000 because the curry smell became a \"massive problem\" and he was forced to rip up the carpet and take the house off the market for six months. \"If that makes me racist, that makes 99% of people who buy houses racist,\" he said. \"How many white people are going to go into a house that smells of curry and are going to buy [it]?\" The Equality and Human Rights Commission is investigating and says it will seek legal action where necessary. Ms Hilsenrath said: \"There are still deep inequalities in our society as our race report demonstrated and these comments show why. \"As a country we all assume we have left the dark ages behind, but clearly there is more to be done. \"We will investigate and will be asking Mr Wilson to explain his actions. Unless we are satisfied that he will not break the law in the future we will take legal action\". Kent Police also said it was working to establish if any offences had taken place.

Many had expected Mr Scioli to lead by a greater margin. The run-off on 22 November will be the first time an Argentine election will be decided by a second round. With 96% of the votes counted, Mr Scioli was marginally ahead with 36.7% of the vote, while Mr Macri had 34.5%. To win outright in the first round, a candidate needed 45% of the vote or a minimum of 40% as well as a 10-point lead over the nearest rival. \"What happened today will change politics in this country,\" Mr Macri, the mayor of Buenos Aires, told supporters. Sergio Massa, a former ally turned rival of outgoing President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, came a distant third with 21.3% of the vote and admitted defeat. Mr Massa has not said who will get his backing in the second round next month. With Mr Macri and Mr Scioli neck-and-neck, Mr Massa's support could prove crucial. Mr Scioli was handpicked as candidate by President Fernandez, who is constitutionally barred from seeking a third term. The governor of Buenos Aires province, he is a former world powerboating champion who lost his right arm in a race in 1989. Late on Sunday, he spoke before thousands of his supporters, saying: \"United together we will triumph. I call upon the undecided and independent voters to join this cause.\" Last week, Mr Scioli pledged tax cuts for workers earning under a certain income, a move expected to affect half a million people. He has also vowed to bring down Argentina's inflation to single digits in less than four years and promises to introduce policy changes to invigorate the economy. Ms Fernandez, who stands down after eight years in power, says she leaves Argentines a better country. \"We are voting today in a completely normal country,\" said Ms Fernandez said after casting her vote in the Patagonian town of Rio Gallegos. In previous decades, Argentines always went to the polls \"in the middle of a serious crisis,\" she added. Ms Fernandez said achieving stability and leaving Argentines \"a normal country\" was the promise made by her late husband, Neston Kirchner, when he took office in 2003. He died in 2010, three years after handing over the presidency to his wife.

While the country gained strength after a financial crisis in 2002, its economy, the third-largest in Latin America, has slowed in recent years, with GDP growing by only 0.5% last year. The government is also locked in a battle against American hedge funds who disagree with how it wants to restructure $100bn (Â£65bn) of debt on which it defaulted in 2001.

The third in line to the throne and future king turns one on 22 July. The design of the sterling silver piece was approved by his parents; his great-grandmother the Queen; and Chancellor George Osborne. It bears the heraldic royal arms and the year 2014. Prince George was photographed at the weekend walking with the help of his mother. Shane Bissett, director of commemorative coin and bullion at the Royal Mint, said: \"We felt there could be no more fitting design to mark the first birthday of our future king than the royal arms - the arms of the monarch - minted in honour of the future heir to the throne. \"The choice of a silver coin is significant too, as the precious metal is closely associated with newborn babies... \"Crossing the palm of a newborn baby with silver is a way to wish them wealth and good health throughout their life, whilst the £5 coin is a favourite for royal celebrations.\" The coins will be a limited mintage of 7,500 and will cost £80 each from the Royal Mint.

It also said it plans to shed another 2,000 positions in its retail banking division, on top of the 2,000 already announced. The bank issued three profit warnings last year. It posted a 16% fall in operating profit in October last year due to a restructuring of its South Korean business and an increase in bad loans. The bank's Hong Kong-listed shares were up more than 2% on Thursday as investors welcomed the cost-cutting news. Standard Chartered told its investors in November last year it would try to deliver $400m in cost savings this year. It said on Thursday it was on track to deliver those savings. Some 2,000 job cuts had been announced or completed in its retail sector over the last three months, the lender said, \"with a reduction of a further 2,000 expected during 2015.\" The bank also said in November that it would close up to 100 bank branches in 2015 in Asia, Africa and the Middle East in an attempt to boost its profitability. On Thursday it said it had made \"good progress in closing 22 branches in the second half of 2014\" and that it was on track to close up to 100.

The money was widely used to attract investment and jobs to Wales. The archives also show UK Treasury concern at overfunding of Scotland and Northern Ireland under the Barnett formula, a political issue to this day. In the mid-1980s, Wales secured one fifth of inward investment into the UK despite having only 5% of the population. But with the then Conservative government trying to cut public spending, the Treasury tried to cut back regional spending in England. That could have hit the Welsh Office budget and the secretary of state Nicholas Edwards joined his Scottish counterpart George Younger to protest. In a letter to the Treasury chief secretary (and fellow Welshman) Peter Rees - copied to the prime minister - Mr Edwards complained about the implications for his budget. He wrote: \"I agree strongly with the points George Younger has made in his letter. They apply equally in the three territories. The political effects in Wales, as in Scotland, would be most damaging.\" Mr Edwards demanded to be present at meetings between the Treasury and Department for Trade and Industry when the issue was discussed. The archives do not record any reply and Mr Edwards - now Lord Crickhowell - cannot recall the episode. But, in another parallel with today's politics, the archives show Treasury concern at overfunding of Scotland and Northern Ireland under the so-called Barnett formula that is also used to calculate changes in the Welsh budget. Peter Rees, later Lord Rees of Goytre, wrote to Mrs Thatcher: \"Even our predecessors never saw it as any more than a stop-gap arrangement on the road to political devolution, certainly not as the permanency it has now become. \"Be that as it may, the block system is now publicly construed, in the territories, as apolitical entitlement to public expenditure. The longer we let it run the harder it becomes to challenge that perception, and the greater the risk of political repercussion when we do. \" MP David Willetts, then a Downing Street adviser, wrote: \"Scotland and NI have their snouts well and truly in the public expenditure trough. The challenge is to find a politically acceptable way of putting them on the same diet as the English.\" The files reveal that the Treasury considered suspending the formula. Mr Rees wrote to Mrs Thatcher: \"The 'fallback' approach to securing savings is to suspend the operation of the comparability formulae for the Scottish and Northern Ireland blocks - though not for Wales, where over-provision is not suspected.\" Thirty years on, the UK political parties have vowed to keep the formula as part of a deal to keep Scotland in the United Kingdom. Mrs Thatcher's ministers considered launching the controversial poll tax in Wales before England, according to other files just released. The documents released by the National Archives also show Conservative government advisers feared a repeat of the 1984-85 miners' strike the following winter.

The SGA has called for a public inquiry into the impact of the reintroduction of the birds on the east coast. RSPB Scotland has described the small child claim as \"alarmist nonsense\". The Scottish government said it was not aware of any attacks by sea eagles on children in other countries and did not think a public inquiry was necessary. In a letter to the Scottish government, the SGA warned that the attack on the Very Reverend Hunter Farquharson in Abernethy, in Perthshire, could be the first of many. The association has asked for the formulation of an \"exit strategy\" if the sea eagles turn out to have an adverse effect on social, economic or leisure activities. In the letter, the SGA said: \"These creatures are being released into what is a comparatively densely populated area so they will come into contact with humans on a daily basis. \"That will instil habituated behaviour and remove what should be a healthy fear of humans. \"There are reports of buzzards which have obviously undergone this desensitisation and this has resulted in them attacking people. This could pose a serious threat in the future. \"Will these very large creatures differentiate between a small child and more natural quarry?\" The Perth-based SGA represents gamekeepers, stalkers, ghillies, wildlife managers and rangers. Association committee member Bert Burnett said the group did not have a problem with sea eagles on Scotland's west coast. He said: \"As far as we are concerned these sea eagles seem to be doing fine and not posing a threat.\" However, Mr Burnett said more consultation was needed on the release of the birds on the east coast. He added: \"Some might think this is gamekeepers making a fuss for some obscure reason. \"That's not the case. It is a genuine concern and it is a concern felt by other people out there other than gamekeepers.\" On the micro blogging website Twitter, RSPB Scotland tweeted: \"Alarmist nonsense from the SGA. \"Sea eagle could soon be eating small children. Surely ScotGov won't take this seriously.\" A spokesman for RSPB Scotland said the Perthshire incident was unfortunate and regrettable but that the bird had reacted as other wild animals might do when cornered. He said the SGA claim about eagles, the UK's largest bird of prey, targeting small children as ridiculous. With a wing span of 8ft, the white-tailed sea eagle is the UK's largest bird of prey. It was completely wiped out in Britain in the early 20th Century and only returned when a reintroduction programme began on the island of Rum in 1975. Mull, Wester Ross and Skye also now have established populations. In August this year, a new batch of 16 young sea eagles were released in Fife. A Scottish government said the raptors were widespread in many parts of Europe, including densely populated areas.

Gavin Chambers, an RSPB warden, tweeted pictures of vivid green in the sky over Lake Vyrnwy in Powys, Wales, saying: \"Well worth getting back out of bed for!!\" Donna Butcher tweeted: \"Just been watching an amazing display of Aurora from Staveley, Cumbria. Shafts of light streaming directly towards Polaris.\" You can email your pictures and video to yourpics@bbc.co.uk, and find out more about the Northern Lights here.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\nThere have been spectacular displays of the Aurora Borealis - better known as the Northern Lights - across parts of the UK overnight.\n\n###\nArticle: The astronomer, who presented The Sky At Night for over 50 years, died at his home in Selsey, West Sussex, in December 2012.

The Australian Broadcasting Corp. quoted Sophia's grandmother, Vera Cook, who credited the dog with saving the toddler's life. She said that Sophia was wearing just a nappy and T-shirt when she wandered off. \"The only thing I was thinking was well, hopefully the dog would have kept her warm,\" Ms Cook was quoted as saying. \"If [the dog] wasn't with her, I don't know whether they would have found her.\" The family issued a statement thanking emergency services and promising that Poppy would be \"well fed this evening\".\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\nA pet dog is being credited with keeping a little girl safe after the pair wandered away from their family home and could not be found for hours.\n\n###\nArticle: The organisers of Common People commissioned the inflatable structure for the event on Southampton Common on Saturday and Sunday. The castle, measuring 23.8m by 20.7m by 12.8m, is taller than the Great Wall of China and can be used by 100 people. It will also appear at the organisers' other festivals - Bestival on the Isle of Wight and Camp Bestival in Dorset. Festival organiser Rob da Bank said: \"We do love breaking a record and this is one of our funnest builds so far.\" There is currently no record for the world's biggest bouncy castle. Guinness World Records is yet to verify the record. Common People, now in its second year, features Duran Duran, Primal Scream, Craig David and Public Enemy. For the first time, a simultaneous event is also being held in South Parks, Oxford. The current record for a bouncy castle was set in 1997 by Dana Caspersen and William Forsythe, the festival said. The castle, measuring 19m by 19m by 12m, took six hours to erect at the Roundhouse in Camden, north London.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nA 23.8m by 20.7m by 12.8m bouncy castle has been built for a festival in Southampton.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "A", "▁", "2", "3", ".", "8", "m", "▁by", "▁", "2", "0", ".", "7", "m", "▁by", "▁", "1", "2", ".", "8", "m", "▁b", "oun", "cy", "▁castle", "▁has", "▁been", "▁built", "▁for", "▁a", "▁festival", "▁in", "▁South", "am", "pton", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁The", "▁", "2", "4", "-", "year", "-", "old", "▁was", "▁arrested", "▁on", "▁susp", "icion", "▁of", "▁murder", "▁and", "▁later", "▁released", "▁under"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.39280274510383606, -0.7170305848121643, -0.008944799192249775, -0.0011151769431307912, -0.002954049501568079, 0.0, -0.0013705631718039513, -0.0017746428493410349, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -3.2543604902457446e-05, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.010722876526415348, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.07917030155658722, -3.3378546504536644e-06, -0.10329323261976242, -0.053836606442928314, -0.045268841087818146, -0.01029290072619915, -0.0013238961109891534, -0.34504255652427673, 0.0, 0.0, -0.6935386061668396, -3.5523738915799186e-05, 0.0, -4.768370445162873e-07, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.023654289543628693, -0.058530405163764954, -0.41930657625198364, -0.1637377142906189, -0.00011062010162277147, -2.622600959512056e-06, 0.0, 0.0, -0.8154968619346619, -0.7116745114326477, -0.3079756200313568, -0.018820870667696, 0.0, 0.0, -0.09514112770557404, -0.5253702402114868, -0.8476901054382324, -0.8769502639770508, -0.25467896461486816], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "A": -0.39280274510383606, "▁": -0.058530405163764954, "2": -0.41930657625198364, "3": -0.0011151769431307912, ".": -0.6935386061668396, "8": 0.0, "m": 0.0, "▁by": -3.2543604902457446e-05, "0": 0.0, "7": 0.0, "1": 0.0, "▁b": -0.010722876526415348, "oun": 0.0, "cy": 0.0, "▁castle": 0.0, "▁has": -0.07917030155658722, "▁been": -3.3378546504536644e-06, "▁built": -0.10329323261976242, "▁for": -0.053836606442928314, "▁a": -0.045268841087818146, "▁festival": -0.01029290072619915, "▁in": -0.0013238961109891534, "▁South": -0.34504255652427673, "am": 0.0, "pton": 0.0, "##": -4.768370445162873e-07, "#": 0.0, "Art": 0.0, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "▁The": -0.023654289543628693, "4": -0.1637377142906189, "-": 0.0, "year": -2.622600959512056e-06, "old": 0.0, "▁was": -0.8154968619346619, "▁arrested": -0.7116745114326477, "▁on": -0.3079756200313568, "▁susp": -0.018820870667696, "icion": 0.0, "▁of": 0.0, "▁murder": -0.09514112770557404, "▁and": -0.5253702402114868, "▁later": -0.8476901054382324, "▁released": -0.8769502639770508, "▁under": -0.25467896461486816}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

The claim was made on the first day of a two-week review into some of the most controversial killings of the Troubles. The review is looking at 56 cases involving 97 deaths. They include killings by police officers and soldiers, and others where there are allegations of state collusion. A senior judge, Lord Justice Weir, is assessing what more needs to be done before inquests can be held to establish what happened. In his opening remarks, the judge said he hopes the review \"will shed some light on the cases without producing too much heat\". The review began with a discussion about so-called \"shoot to kill cases\", when RUC officers shot dead six unarmed republicans. A number of lawyers said the time taken by the police to disclose classified documents was the reason inquests had not yet taken place. A barrister for the PSNI said it simply does not have the resources to deal with the vast amount of material relating to legacy cases. But, a lawyer for the families of two of the men who were shot dead said they believe the PSNI is deliberately dragging its heels. Barry McDonald QC said the lack of disclosure of material by the PSNI was the biggest single impediment to the inquests taking place. \"Any time there is light at the end of the tunnel for the families, the PSNI extends the tunnel,\" he told the court. The killings of 10 unarmed Catholic civilians by the army in Ballymurphy in August 1971 were also discussed on Monday. It was revealed that the Ministry of Defence has told lawyers representing the families of those who were killed that it cannot identify the soldiers who were on duty in Ballymurphy at the time of the shootings. The court was told that so far, the Army has only managed to trace one soldier. Lord Justice Weir stressed the importance of the army witnesses being found. \"At the end of the day, we want to hear about the circumstances in which these people were shot, and those best placed to do that are those who shot them,\" he said. The judge said it was in everyone's interests that the soldiers who were there and fired shots came forward and explained why they did so. Lord Justice Weir has been asked to report on the state of readiness of each of the 56 legacy cases, and to identify which, if any, can proceed to inquest hearings. It will then be up to the Lord Chief Justice, Sir Declan Morgan, to decide what happens next. Likening the legacy inquests to spinning plates, the judge said \"there simply aren't enough resources to spin all of the plates all of the time\". He said he hopes the two week review will lead to an agreement about \"which plates need to spin more urgently\".\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nA lawyer for the families of two unarmed republicans shot dead by the RUC in 1982 said they believe the PSNI is trying protect the RUC's reputation .\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "A", "▁lawyer", "▁for", "▁the", "▁families", "▁of", "▁two", "▁un", "ar", "med", "▁republic", "ans", "▁shot", "▁dead", "▁by", "▁the", "▁R", "UC", "▁in", "▁", "1", "9", "8", "2", "▁said", "▁they", "▁believe", "▁the", "▁PS", "NI", "▁is", "▁trying", "▁protect", "▁the", "▁R", "UC", "'", "s", "▁reputation", "▁.", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁The", "▁PS", "NI", "▁has", "▁been", "▁accused", "▁of", "▁trying", "▁to", "▁protect", "▁the", "▁R", "UC", "'", "s"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.08000533282756805, -0.002945016138255596, -0.0003692421887535602, -0.0012731788447126746, -5.006777428206988e-06, 0.0, -0.0005972985527478158, -0.00024637524620629847, 0.0, 0.0, -0.00018142008048016578, -2.50339189733495e-06, -0.00017438798386137933, 0.0, -3.576278118089249e-07, -7.152555099310121e-07, -3.576278118089249e-07, 0.0, -3.576278118089249e-07, -2.3841855067985307e-07, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.001938013592734933, -3.814689989667386e-06, -0.11735103279352188, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -1.9788545614574105e-05, -0.00292397802695632, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.07899550348520279, -0.38901978731155396, 0.0, -0.08876657485961914, 0.0, 0.0, -1.4305012882687151e-05, 0.0, 0.0, -0.2632547914981842, -0.22106945514678955, 0.0, -0.4305912256240845, -0.10610872507095337, -0.006459073629230261, -6.890059739816934e-05, -0.00748058594763279, -1.6689286894688848e-06, -2.3483953555114567e-05, -1.7881377516459906e-06, -0.6931502819061279, 0.0, -2.3841855067985307e-07, 0.0], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "A": -0.08000533282756805, "▁lawyer": -0.002945016138255596, "▁for": -0.0003692421887535602, "▁the": -1.7881377516459906e-06, "▁families": -5.006777428206988e-06, "▁of": -6.890059739816934e-05, "▁two": -0.0005972985527478158, "▁un": -0.00024637524620629847, "ar": 0.0, "med": 0.0, "▁republic": -0.00018142008048016578, "ans": -2.50339189733495e-06, "▁shot": -0.00017438798386137933, "▁dead": 0.0, "▁by": -3.576278118089249e-07, "▁R": -0.6931502819061279, "UC": 0.0, "▁in": -3.576278118089249e-07, "▁": -2.3841855067985307e-07, "1": 0.0, "9": 0.0, "8": 0.0, "2": 0.0, "▁said": -0.001938013592734933, "▁they": -3.814689989667386e-06, "▁believe": -0.11735103279352188, "▁PS": -0.22106945514678955, "NI": 0.0, "▁is": 0.0, "▁trying": -0.00748058594763279, "▁protect": -2.3483953555114567e-05, "'": -2.3841855067985307e-07, "s": 0.0, "▁reputation": 0.0, "▁.": -0.07899550348520279, "##": -0.08876657485961914, "#": 0.0, "Art": -1.4305012882687151e-05, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "▁The": -0.2632547914981842, "▁has": -0.4305912256240845, "▁been": -0.10610872507095337, "▁accused": -0.006459073629230261, "▁to": -1.6689286894688848e-06}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

But he has since found it difficult to get treatment, his marriage has failed and he is struggling to find work. For a number of nights each week, Mr Smith parks in a lay-by and sleeps in his car, to get away from people and control his anger management issues. \"I just don't like being around people sometimes I just want to close myself off. Basically I don't like living on people's sofas, I am not relying on people to put up with me. When I am depressed I would rather be alone so I've just got used to doing it now,\" he told the Victoria Derbyshire programme. \"I have got my quilt and stuff in the back and I have got my internal wifi here so it's like a mobile house.\" It is thought Mr Smith's PTSD was sparked after the vehicle patrol he was part of was blown up by roadside bombs twice in a week in 2005. The medically trained fusilier tried to help many of his colleagues who had received terrible injuries. \"I took a lot of guilt because obviously I thought I did my best at the time when I was treating them. I didn't really think they would die, I just thought they would be injured or go back home, but they passed away and obviously that was a big shock to us and I didn't know how to take that,\" he said. \"I became a bit scared then. I didn't know what to think or what my next step would be. Because it happened to me twice and I thought it will happen to me third time unlucky.\" The Ministry of Defence citation when he received his medal said: \"With no regard for his own safety and with his focus firmly on saving those in the vehicle, he commenced the evacuation of the casualties from the burning chaos.\" What is PTSD? Post-traumatic stress disorder is an anxiety disorder caused by witnessing or being involved in a frightening or distressing event. People naturally feel afraid when in danger, but the legacy of some traumatic events is a change in perception of fear. They may feel stressed or frightened in day-to-day life. Diagnosing PTSD But Mr Smith, now 31, blames himself for not being able to save his friends and does not think he deserves the medal. In fact, he does not really remember being awarded it by Prince Charles. \"I didn't really take it all in, I was very numb that day because I was on medication anyway so my mood and my temperament wasn't the best,\" he says. Figures from veterans' mental health charity Combat Stress show Mr Smith is not alone.

Rescuers found Sophia and Poppy 200m from a dam on the family's property. The Australian Broadcasting Corp. quoted Sophia's grandmother, Vera Cook, who credited the dog with saving the toddler's life. She said that Sophia was wearing just a nappy and T-shirt when she wandered off. \"The only thing I was thinking was well, hopefully the dog would have kept her warm,\" Ms Cook was quoted as saying. \"If [the dog] wasn't with her, I don't know whether they would have found her.\" The family issued a statement thanking emergency services and promising that Poppy would be \"well fed this evening\".\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\nA pet dog is being credited with keeping a little girl safe after the pair wandered away from their family home and could not be found for hours.\n\n###\nArticle: As German and Italian troops occupied Greece, tens of thousands of people fled by sea to refugee camps in the Middle East. At the end of the war, they began heading home. Most made it back safely, but for some the journey ended in tragedy. \"An event like this is hard to forget,\" says Eleni Karavelatzi. \"It leaves you seared with scars and makes you bitter forever.\" Eleni Karavelatzi was 12 months old when in 1942 her family fled the Nazi occupation of Kastelorizo, a Greek island 2km (1.5 miles) from the Turkish coast. They sailed first to Cyprus and then to a refugee camp in Gaza known as El Nuseirat. They stayed there until the end of the war. In September 1945, a British vessel, the SS Empire Patrol, left the Egyptian city of Port Said carrying Eleni's family and 500 other Greek refugees. Within hours, fire broke out onboard. Thirty-three passengers died, including 14 children. From her garden on Kastelorizo, Eleni can now see the EU border agency ship searching for new migrants and reminisces about what happened in 1945. \"My parents told me that I was tied with a rope and lowered on to a raft. But as they were letting me down, my father saw that it was full and ordered me back. As soon as I was brought up, a woman jumped on the dinghy. It capsized and all the children drowned.\" Among the victims were Eleni's three cousins, whose names are carved on a monument a short distance from where she lives. To the east of the monument lives Kastelorizo's only other survivor, Maria Chroni, who lives with her granddaughter. Maria Chroni, who was born in 1937, clung for life on a piece of wreckage. \"I found myself at sea holding on to a wooden plank.\" \"How it happened, I can't remember. I only know I that I stayed in this position for 10 hours. Then my father rescued me and lifted me into the charred boat.\" From Aleppo to Egypt and beyond Other Greek refugees had fled the Nazi occupation to Syria. They were mainly from the island of Chios, a few kilometres off the Turkey coast. \"The Germans were here and we were hungry. I was three back then,\" remembers Marianthi Andreadi. \"So we left for Turkey illegally and from there we took the train to Al Nayrab camp in Aleppo (Syria).\" Marianthi remembers some of the faces that stood out on her journey. \"I was surrounded by older women. And there was this moment that stays with me when we were on the Turkish border and the guard yells 'Gel Burda! Gel Burda!' (come here).\" \"We ran away quickly. I fell down. And eventually he let us go. But I never forgot this.\" Greek archives reveal Al Nayrab camp was less a permanent settlement than a meeting point, says Iakovos Michailidis, professor of history at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. \"People were brought here for short periods of time before being sent to various parts of the Middle East, or even Africa.\" Ioannis Stekas\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nAfter World War Two, thousands of Greek refugees who had fled to the Middle East began returning home.

The Australian Broadcasting Corp. quoted Sophia's grandmother, Vera Cook, who credited the dog with saving the toddler's life.

It gave them a 2-0 T20 series win to go with their 3-2 one-day series victory. \"The first half of the trip was very exciting,\" Bayliss said. \"But we got worse as the series went on, and South Africa got better.\" England won the four-match Test series 2-1 and took a 2-0 lead in the one-day international contest, before losing the final five fixtures on the tour (three ODIs and two T20s). Their batting collapsed dramatically at the Wanderers, with seven wickets falling for 14 runs and the bowlers were then subjected to an onslaught from De Villiers and Hashim Amla, who took their team to 121-0 after just eight overs. The South Africans struck 16 fours and nine sixes, with Amla unbeaten on 69 from 38 balls. Such an emphatic defeat was ominous for England, who begin their ICC World Twenty20 campaign against West Indies in Mumbai on 16 March and face South Africa two days later. \"It's a bit of a reminder for people at home not to get too far ahead of themselves,\" Bayliss admitted. \"We have played some good cricket, but this is a young group of players and performances like this will happen from time to time.\" The tourists changed their team for Sunday's match at the Wanderers, bringing in batsman Sam Billings for bowling all-rounder David Willey. \"In India we'll definitely be playing two spinners, so we just wanted to try having that extra batter, which we've done before, and just the five bowlers,\" Bayliss added. Asked about the effects of a long tour he added: \"I'm sure fatigue had a very small part to do with it, probably more mental than anything else. We've been away for five months apart from a week in between, when you count the UAE. \"But that's something these young players have got to get used to and if that's part of the learning curve for these young guys, there's something to learn from.\" England skipper Eoin Morgan, who was run out at the non striker's end for 38, lamented: \"Quite simply, we underperformed. \"The majority of our batting went really well - we were on course to get 185, 190, possibly 200. \"Myself and Jos Buttler were going really well, then we lost two wickets in two balls, and then from there we lost six wickets in the space of no time. I don't think we were too far behind the game, but the way we started with the ball allowed South Africa to get on top. \"The inconsistency is because we are inexperienced, and that is going to come. With that comes a great brand of cricket that is really exciting and can beat any side in the world.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nSouth Africa beat England by 84 runs in the third and final Twenty20 international at Johannesburg on Sunday.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "S", "outh", "▁Africa", "▁beat", "▁England", "▁by", "▁", "8", "4", "▁runs", "▁in", "▁the", "▁third", "▁and", "▁final", "▁Tw", "enty", "2", "0", "▁international", "▁at", "▁Johannes", "burg", "▁on", "▁Sunday", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁The", "▁", "2", "5", "-", "year", "-", "old", "▁was", "▁arrested", "▁in", "▁the", "▁early", "▁hours", "▁of", "▁Saturday", "▁morning", "▁after", "▁a", "▁night", "▁out", "▁in", "▁the", "▁town", "▁of", "▁Al", "buf", "e", "ira"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.36106228828430176, 0.0, 0.0, -0.02424740418791771, -3.576278118089249e-07, -0.002924809930846095, -0.037120502442121506, -0.06471189856529236, -1.1920928244535389e-07, 0.0, -0.00036054308293387294, -0.0003682888636831194, -0.7009887099266052, -0.12772855162620544, 0.0, -0.17306731641292572, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.5548580884933472, -0.28196340799331665, -0.6931556463241577, 0.0, -0.12005380541086197, -4.768370445162873e-07, -0.7464898228645325, -0.0500190369784832, 0.0, -0.00037508129025809467, 0.0, 0.0, -3.576278118089249e-07, 0.0, 0.0, -0.025965631008148193, -0.30167385935783386, -0.17104312777519226, -0.074966199696064, -0.0020935065113008022, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -2.0861407392658293e-05, 0.0, -0.6762720346450806, -0.7333294153213501, -0.5929530262947083, -0.09340092539787292, -0.18231920897960663, -8.583032467868179e-06, -6.318072337307967e-06, -0.31668317317962646, -0.003954211715608835, -0.9089288115501404, -0.06915393471717834, -0.846939206123352, -0.0068216766230762005, -0.05559961870312691, -0.008958976715803146, -0.07505622506141663, -0.13770411908626556, -1.4374736547470093, -0.005981283728033304, 0.0, 0.0], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "S": -0.36106228828430176, "outh": 0.0, "▁Africa": 0.0, "▁beat": -0.02424740418791771, "▁England": -3.576278118089249e-07, "▁by": -0.002924809930846095, "▁": -0.30167385935783386, "8": -0.06471189856529236, "4": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "▁runs": 0.0, "▁in": -0.05559961870312691, "▁the": -0.008958976715803146, "▁third": -0.7009887099266052, "▁and": -0.12772855162620544, "▁final": 0.0, "▁Tw": -0.17306731641292572, "enty": 0.0, "2": -0.17104312777519226, "0": 0.0, "▁international": -0.5548580884933472, "▁at": -0.28196340799331665, "▁Johannes": -0.6931556463241577, "burg": 0.0, "▁on": -0.12005380541086197, "▁Sunday": -4.768370445162873e-07, ".": -0.7464898228645325, "##": -0.00037508129025809467, "#": 0.0, "Art": -3.576278118089249e-07, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "▁The": -0.025965631008148193, "5": -0.074966199696064, "-": -2.0861407392658293e-05, "year": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "old": 0.0, "▁was": -0.6762720346450806, "▁arrested": -0.7333294153213501, "▁early": -0.18231920897960663, "▁hours": -8.583032467868179e-06, "▁of": -0.13770411908626556, "▁Saturday": -0.31668317317962646, "▁morning": -0.003954211715608835, "▁after": -0.9089288115501404, "▁a": -0.06915393471717834, "▁night": -0.846939206123352, "▁out": -0.0068216766230762005, "▁town": -0.07505622506141663, "▁Al": -1.4374736547470093, "buf": -0.005981283728033304, "e": 0.0, "ira": 0.0}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

McClair, who takes over the role following the departure of Dutchman Mark Wotte, spent almost 30 years at Old Trafford as a player, youth coach and director of the youth academy. The SFA said he \"was identified unanimously as preferred candidate during a recruitment process which involved the current Scotland national coach, Gordon Strachan, previous national coaches Walter Smith and Andy Roxburgh, as well as the Scottish FA's chief executive, Stewart Regan\". McClair begins in the role on 1 June and will be responsible for implementing the SFA's performance strategy. He added: \"I am extremely proud to have been given the responsibility to help Scottish football move forward as performance director of the Scottish FA. \"Having spent the majority of the last 30 years in England with Manchester United, I am looking forward to coming home, working with the coaching team at the Scottish FA and the clubs, and sharing the knowledge I have built up in that time to take on this new, exciting challenge.\" Having started his playing career at Motherwell, McClair moved to Celtic in 1983 and went on to score 126 goals in 204 matches. He then joined Manchester United, where he made 471 appearances between 1987 and 1998. He scored 126 goals for the Old Trafford side and won four Premier League titles, one European Cup-winners' Cup, one European Super Cup, three FA Cups and one League Cup. \"The process of identifying a new performance director was thorough and hugely uplifting when we considered the quality of candidates,\" Regan added. \"Brian very quickly became a stand-out with his blend of experiences, not just from his trophy-laden career as a player at Manchester United, and his international contribution, but the depth of his coaching experiences with one of the biggest and most successful teams in the world. \"He has been at the cutting edge of coaching evolution, analysis and performance management at Manchester United and the recruitment panel were convinced he was the ideal person to lead the performance strategy into an exciting new era, enhancing the current provision while demonstrating the benefits of the investment so far to the future of Scottish football.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nBrian McClair, a former Manchester United player and coach, has been appointed performance director of the Scottish Football Association.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "B", "rian", "▁McC", "la", "ir", ",", "▁a", "▁former", "▁Manchester", "▁United", "▁player", "▁and", "▁coach", ",", "▁has", "▁been", "▁appointed", "▁performance", "▁director", "▁of", "▁the", "▁Scottish", "▁Football", "▁Association", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁The", "▁", "5", "1", "-", "year", "-", "old", ",", "▁who", "▁won", "▁", "3", "0", "▁caps", "▁for", "▁Scotland", ",", "▁was", "▁recently", "▁the", "▁director", "▁of", "▁Manchester", "▁United", "'", "s", "▁youth", "▁a", "cademy"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.05318336561322212, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.8915225863456726, -0.5689103603363037, -8.940297266235575e-05, -0.12489467114210129, 0.0, -0.13238631188869476, -0.5156654715538025, -0.030899731442332268, -1.9788545614574105e-05, -0.09096883237361908, -2.7418097943154862e-06, -0.36105698347091675, -0.2671906352043152, 0.0, -0.0074472189880907536, -1.7881377516459906e-06, 0.0, -0.0012729407753795385, 0.0, -0.08012890070676804, -0.0008507922757416964, 0.0, -0.07892235368490219, 0.0, 0.0, -7.152555099310121e-07, 0.0, 0.0, -0.17525619268417358, -0.002523097675293684, -0.3306002914905548, -0.0013424679636955261, -0.17301055788993835, 0.0, -3.6954811548639555e-06, 0.0, -0.00115863885730505, 0.0, -3.576278118089249e-07, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -1.1920928244535389e-07, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "B": -0.05318336561322212, "rian": 0.0, "▁McC": 0.0, "la": 0.0, "ir": 0.0, ",": 0.0, "▁a": 0.0, "▁former": -8.940297266235575e-05, "▁Manchester": 0.0, "▁United": 0.0, "▁player": -0.13238631188869476, "▁and": -0.5156654715538025, "▁coach": -0.030899731442332268, "▁has": -0.09096883237361908, "▁been": -2.7418097943154862e-06, "▁appointed": -0.36105698347091675, "▁performance": -0.2671906352043152, "▁director": 0.0, "▁of": 0.0, "▁the": 0.0, "▁Scottish": 0.0, "▁Football": -0.0012729407753795385, "▁Association": 0.0, ".": -0.08012890070676804, "##": -0.07892235368490219, "#": 0.0, "Art": -7.152555099310121e-07, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "▁The": -0.17525619268417358, "▁": 0.0, "5": -0.3306002914905548, "1": -0.0013424679636955261, "-": -3.6954811548639555e-06, "year": 0.0, "old": 0.0, "▁who": 0.0, "▁won": -3.576278118089249e-07, "3": 0.0, "0": 0.0, "▁caps": 0.0, "▁for": 0.0, "▁Scotland": 0.0, "▁was": 0.0, "▁recently": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "'": 0.0, "s": 0.0, "▁youth": 0.0, "cademy": 0.0}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

After medication and steroids failed to improve his condition, he decided to undergo surgery six weeks ago. Speaking to BBC Radio Wales' Jason Mohammad programme, Mr Bennett said he wanted to help other people like him. Talking about his decision to have surgery, he said: \"It was very hard. It was quite a long process really. \"In my head I was thinking 'why am I going to wait until I'm really ill to go into surgery when it's inevitable?\" Mr Bennett posted the picture on the Crohn's and Colitis UK Facebook page to show what \"a normal person\" looks like with a colostomy bag. \"If you have surgery there's nothing really to worry about... it does get better,\" he added. Dan McClean, director of marketing at Crohn's and Colitis UK, described Luke as an \"inspiration\". \"We are currently seeing this inflammatory bowel disease being diagnosed in about 10,000 younger people a year,\" he said. \"To see Luke's story is very inspiring for a lot of people.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nA man with inflammatory bowel disease has posted a picture of himself wearing a colostomy bag to help others with the condition.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "A", "▁man", "▁with", "▁infl", "am", "mat", "ory", "▁bow", "el", "▁disease", "▁has", "▁posted", "▁a", "▁picture", "▁of", "▁himself", "▁we", "aring", "▁a", "▁col", "ost", "omy", "▁bag", "▁to", "▁help", "▁others", "▁with", "▁the", "▁condition", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁The", "▁government", "▁is", "▁to", "▁spend", "▁£", "4", "0", "m", "▁on", "▁a", "▁new", "▁centre", "▁to", "▁help", "▁people", "▁with", "▁de", "ment", "ia", "▁and", "▁their", "▁families", ".", "▁The"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -5.5549986427649856e-05, -0.4887664318084717, -0.08941628038883209, -0.871492326259613, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.004840323235839605, -0.47287848591804504, -4.410734163684538e-06, -0.04055573046207428, -0.0014085381990298629, -0.0012854416854679585, -0.41037216782569885, 0.0, -1.2993727978027891e-05, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.006367750931531191, -0.3792003393173218, -0.2541888952255249, -0.018970603123307228, -0.004432496149092913, -0.0005588161875493824, -0.0002989322238136083, 0.0, 0.0, -3.6954811548639555e-06, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.3621300756931305, -0.15816497802734375, -0.31186795234680176, -0.024600358679890633, -0.6214302778244019, -0.12217722088098526, -0.7069239020347595, -0.2259434312582016, -0.3655790090560913, -0.36336538195610046, -0.0025688763707876205, -0.0014515112852677703, -0.4408600330352783, -0.088422030210495, -0.054324593394994736, -0.1309204399585724, -0.0021423976868391037, -0.9429819583892822, -1.9788545614574105e-05, 0.0, -0.023268042132258415, -2.861018856492592e-06, -0.25194481015205383, -0.3614926338195801, -0.0019402741454541683], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "A": -5.5549986427649856e-05, "▁man": -0.4887664318084717, "▁with": -0.0021423976868391037, "▁infl": -0.871492326259613, "am": 0.0, "mat": 0.0, "ory": 0.0, "▁bow": 0.0, "el": 0.0, "▁disease": 0.0, "▁has": -0.004840323235839605, "▁posted": -0.47287848591804504, "▁a": -0.0025688763707876205, "▁picture": -0.04055573046207428, "▁of": -0.0014085381990298629, "▁himself": -0.0012854416854679585, "▁we": -0.41037216782569885, "aring": 0.0, "▁col": 0.0, "ost": 0.0, "omy": 0.0, "▁bag": 0.0, "▁to": -0.088422030210495, "▁help": -0.054324593394994736, "▁others": -0.2541888952255249, "▁the": -0.004432496149092913, "▁condition": -0.0005588161875493824, ".": -0.3614926338195801, "##": -3.6954811548639555e-06, "#": 0.0, "Art": 0.0, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "▁The": -0.0019402741454541683, "▁government": -0.15816497802734375, "▁is": -0.31186795234680176, "▁spend": -0.6214302778244019, "▁£": -0.12217722088098526, "4": -0.7069239020347595, "0": -0.2259434312582016, "m": -0.3655790090560913, "▁on": -0.36336538195610046, "▁new": -0.0014515112852677703, "▁centre": -0.4408600330352783, "▁people": -0.1309204399585724, "▁de": -0.9429819583892822, "ment": -1.9788545614574105e-05, "ia": 0.0, "▁and": -0.023268042132258415, "▁their": -2.861018856492592e-06, "▁families": -0.25194481015205383}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

Both companies are majority-owned by the state. The announcement comes as Beijing tries to overhaul the steel industry, one of the country's bloated state sectors. The merger will create a new company, China Baowu Iron and Steel Group. Based on data from 2015, the two firms together have an annual production of about 60 million tonnes a year, which would make it the country's largest steelmaker. Globally, it would be second only to Luxembourg-based ArcelorMittal. Baosteel's net profit tumbled 83% to 1bn yuan ($150m) last year, while Wuhan lost 7.5bn yuan, a sharp drop from its 1.3bn yuan net profit in 2014. Steel demand in China, as well as worldwide, has slumped in the past year as the country's economic growth has slowed. The resulting overproduction has seen steelmakers around the world suffer huge losses. China has been accused of price dumping - selling its steel cheaply overseas in order to clear its stocks. In April, China promised to reduce its steel output, following a crisis meeting attended by 30 nations. Over the past 25 years, Chinese steel production has expanded hugely with output growing more than twelve-fold. China produced more than 822 million tonnes of steel in 2014 and is expected to produce even more this year. However, projected demand for its steel in 2016 is only 672 million tonnes.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nChina's largest steelmaker, Baosteel, is to take over its smaller rival, Wuhan Iron and Steel, in a deal that will create a new company, China Baowu Iron and Steel Group.

She said that Sophia was wearing just a nappy and T-shirt when she wandered off. \"The only thing I was thinking was well, hopefully the dog would have kept her warm,\" Ms Cook was quoted as saying. \"If [the dog] wasn't with her, I don't know whether they would have found her.\" The family issued a statement thanking emergency services and promising that Poppy would be \"well fed this evening\".\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\nA pet dog is being credited with keeping a little girl safe after the pair wandered away from their family home and could not be found for hours.\n\n###\nArticle: Addicks supporters have staged a series of protests aimed at the Belgian businessman in recent months, prompting a statement claiming some fans \"want the club to fail\". \"Whether you like protests or not, the fans feel they need to be heard,\" Powell told BBC Radio London. \"They want answers and, quite clearly, they are not getting them.\" Some Charlton fans have formed a campaigning group called CARD (Coalition Against Roland Duchatelet) which is calling for the the Belgian to sell the club. Several protests took place at their last home match against Middlesbrough including a mock funeral, beach balls being thrown onto the pitch to halt the game and a walk-out by supporters in the second half. Last month Duchatelet, who has a network of clubs around Europe, told the South London Press he has \"empathy\" for the fans, but was not prepared to sell. Powell had three stints as a player at The Valley and was manager when Duchatelet took over the club in January 2014 - only to be dismissed in March that year. \"They made the statement last week which I don't think any supporter could understand,\" Powell, 46, added. \"It quite clearly shows there is no synergy between the owners, the higher management and the fans. \"I don't know what will happen. I'm sure many thousands of Charlton fans would like that question to be answered. \"The only person who can answer that question in Roland Duchatelet - but he hasn't.

A member of teaching staff in north Wales was given £100,000 compensation when the chair he sat on collapsed. The NASUWTteaching union said it had won £16,077,328 for members last year. A Department for Education spokesperson said: \"School employers are responsible for the health and safety of staff and pupils whether the local authority, governing body or academy trust, and they must adhere to the Health and Safety Act 1974.\" Teachers also received smaller payouts over accidents in the workplace, including a £55,000 package for a female member of staff in north-west England who tripped on a tear in the lino surface of her science classroom. She was later diagnosed with chronic back syndrome. NASUWT general secretary Chris Keates said many of the injuries would be reduced if employers \"took the welfare of staff seriously\" and followed good health and safety practices. She said: \"The consequence of negligence is careers, lives and health blighted and millions of pounds of public money spent in compensation. \"Unfortunately, there is no incentive for employers to take health and welfare seriously when they witness the government cutting funding for inspection and failing to take steps to secure compliance with the law. \"Failure to respect the rights of employees and to comply with employment law is also prevalent. \"Employers flout the law, but it's the teachers and the taxpayers who pay the price. \"While compensation is important, it can never make up for the fact that teachers suffer permanent physical and mental injury and often cannot continue in their chosen career.\" Separate data from the NUT, which keeps its overall compensation figures private, said there were two cases of personal injury compensation paid to its members last year. One included a £46,000 payout to a teacher who suffered \"severe psychological injury\" following \"a sustained campaign of bullying and harassment by senior leadership\". Another NUT member was awarded just under £4,500 after she fractured a finger on a defective doorknob, causing her long-term aches and a deformity. The union said it offered legal help in 130 cases last year, including 71 involving criminal activity and 57 in employment cases.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nA teacher from London received £185,000 after she slipped a disc in her back after she was knocked to the ground by two unruly pupils.

Dorset Police and Natural England have launched an investigation. Natural England is urging any restaurants or pubs to ask to see a valid licence before buying eggs to prepare in meals. Birds of Poole Harbour had been surveying a group of islands in the harbour when the theft was discovered. Mediterranean gulls are classified as a Schedule One species, meaning anyone disturbing their nests must have a special licence. Paul Morton, who runs the charity, said Mediterranean gulls' eggs were not approved for human consumption, and could be a \"health issue\". \"I'm distraught, really. To see the taking of hundreds and hundreds of eggs from an important colony is quite sickening,\" he said. Mr Moreton said there had been previous convictions for egg poaching in the last 10 or 15 years. He said continued monitoring was needed to understand the effect on the gull population in the harbour, which he said had fallen by 70% since 2008.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nA bird charity is furious after hundreds of eggs from Mediterranean gulls were stolen from islands in Poole Harbour.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "A", "▁bird", "▁char", "ity", "▁is", "▁fur", "ious", "▁after", "▁hundreds", "▁of", "▁eggs", "▁from", "▁Mediter", "rane", "an", "▁g", "ull", "s", "▁were", "▁st", "olen", "▁from", "▁islands", "▁in", "▁Po", "ole", "▁Har", "bour", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁The", "▁", "2", "2", "-", "year", "-", "old", "▁was", "▁arrested", "▁on", "▁susp", "icion", "▁of", "▁murder", "▁and", "▁is", "▁being", "▁held", "▁in", "▁cust", "ody", ".", "▁The", "▁victim", ","], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.15554095804691315, -0.29081037640571594, -0.00017438798386137933, 0.0, -0.4460598826408386, -0.16620789468288422, 0.0, -0.01025207620114088, -0.4121379852294922, 0.0, -0.0027669500559568405, -0.3610840439796448, -0.3884548842906952, 0.0, 0.0, -1.9788545614574105e-05, 0.0, -1.2278481335670222e-05, -0.0352320596575737, -0.0005246216314844787, 0.0, -0.020013656467199326, -0.4549500346183777, -7.152555099310121e-07, -0.0042006829753518105, 0.0, -1.2993727978027891e-05, 0.0, -0.6657715439796448, -5.8412379075889476e-06, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.25296592712402344, -0.08180874586105347, -0.5593897104263306, -0.12029630690813065, -0.0013891342096030712, -1.3232143828645349e-05, -2.50339189733495e-06, 0.0, -0.43169206380844116, -0.5586255192756653, -0.44951432943344116, -0.00546271912753582, 0.0, 0.0, -0.13423006236553192, -0.970852255821228, -0.5909363031387329, -0.5958681106567383, -0.5063743591308594, -0.03509533032774925, -0.18610410392284393, 0.0, -0.006494960747659206, -0.2176162600517273, -0.35843831300735474, -0.7511075139045715], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "A": -0.15554095804691315, "▁bird": -0.29081037640571594, "▁char": -0.00017438798386137933, "ity": 0.0, "▁is": -0.5909363031387329, "▁fur": -0.16620789468288422, "ious": 0.0, "▁after": -0.01025207620114088, "▁hundreds": -0.4121379852294922, "▁of": 0.0, "▁eggs": -0.0027669500559568405, "▁from": -0.020013656467199326, "▁Mediter": -0.3884548842906952, "rane": 0.0, "an": 0.0, "▁g": -1.9788545614574105e-05, "ull": 0.0, "s": -1.2278481335670222e-05, "▁were": -0.0352320596575737, "▁st": -0.0005246216314844787, "olen": 0.0, "▁islands": -0.4549500346183777, "▁in": -0.03509533032774925, "▁Po": -0.0042006829753518105, "ole": 0.0, "▁Har": -1.2993727978027891e-05, "bour": 0.0, ".": -0.006494960747659206, "##": 0.0, "#": 0.0, "Art": 0.0, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "▁The": -0.2176162600517273, "▁": -0.08180874586105347, "2": -0.12029630690813065, "-": -2.50339189733495e-06, "year": -1.3232143828645349e-05, "old": 0.0, "▁was": -0.43169206380844116, "▁arrested": -0.5586255192756653, "▁on": -0.44951432943344116, "▁susp": -0.00546271912753582, "icion": 0.0, "▁murder": -0.13423006236553192, "▁and": -0.970852255821228, "▁being": -0.5958681106567383, "▁held": -0.5063743591308594, "▁cust": -0.18610410392284393, "ody": 0.0, "▁victim": -0.35843831300735474, ",": -0.7511075139045715}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

But the decision was not without controversy, sparking outrage among both UN members and women's rights advocates across the world. More than 1,000 of anonymous and \"concerned\" UN staff members have signed an online petition arguing that Wonder Woman was not an appropriate choice, noting the character's physique as: \"a large breasted, white woman of impossible proportions, scantily clad in a shimmery, thigh-baring body suit with an American flag motif and knee high boots -the epitome of a \"pin-up\" girl\". Critics who signed the petition said it was \"disappointing\" that the UN \"was unable to find a real-life woman that would be able to champion the rights of ALL women on the issue of gender equality and the fight for their empowerment\". The comic book superhero has sprung back into culture relevance with the upcoming release of a new Wonder Woman film starring Israeli actress Gal Gadot, who appeared at the UN ceremony along with actress Lynda Carter, who also portrayed her in the eponymous 1970s US TV series. Wonder Woman, an Amazonian princess who was created by Harvard-trained psychologist William Moulton Marston in 1941, was inspired by the leaders of the suffragist movement and has been long considered a feminist icon. \"The focus [of the UN] was on her feminist background, being the first female superhero in a world of male superheroes and that basically she always fought for fairness, justice and peace,\" UN official Maher Nasser told NPR. The organisation said the character's appointment was meant to \"highlight what we can collectively achieve if women and girls are empowered\" and \"to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls\", according to the UN's website on sustainable development goals. But the honour appeared to be ill-timed. The announcement follows the UN's selection of Portugal's Antonio Guterres as its next Secretary General despite a global push for the organisation to select its first female top diplomat. In fact, a recent analysis found that nine of 10 senior leadership roles at the UN went to men. Prospective female candidates in the race included the former prime minister of New Zealand, the director general of cultural agency Unesco, the Moldovan deputy prime minister and a senior EU official. Why wasn't a woman elected as UN secretary general? \"It is alarming that the United Nations would consider using a character with an overtly sexualized image at a time when the headline news in United States and the world is the objectification of women and girls,\" the petition read. About 100 UN staff members protested the appointment at UN headquarters, bearing signs emblazoned with the words: \"I am not a mascot\" and \"Let's get real\". Outrage reverberated across social media, with women's rights advocates pointing to real-life women who fit the bill over Wonder Woman.

But on a sunny evening in Cheshire, Vaughan, joined by an England legends team including Malcolm, Neil Fairbrother and Adam Hollioake amongst others, turned out to take on Hawk Green's finest on their own turf. Having done a coaching session with the club's youngsters and a Q&A session the England Legends were put into bat first in this Twenty20 encounter, one of three matches the legends have scheduled in order to raise funds for grass roots cricket. Vaughan fell for 17 as the home side made an encouraging start with the ball but the form of Mal Loye, who top-scored for England Legends with 117, ensured the visitors set a tough mark of 194. It was a target which, despite Justin Blackhurst's impressive 88, proved to be too much for the Derbyshire and Cheshire League outfit, who could only make 165 in 20 overs to leave the legends once again victorious.

A former leader of the Progressive Unionist Party, Ms Purvis has been director of the clinic since it was launched in 2012. Ms Purvis, who will step down on 24 April, said it was \"time to move on\". She will take on a new role on the clinic's Northern Ireland advisory board. Last November, anti-abortion protester Bernadette Smyth, who leads the Precious Life group, was convicted of harassing Ms Purvis at the Marie Stopes office in Belfast city centre. Ms Purvis told the BBC that had had no influence on her decision to step down. \"I think the clinic's well established here now, we're providing services more and more every year and I'm delighted to be remaining on the advisory board for the clinic. \"But I feel it's time to move on and I think it's time for Marie Stopes to get someone else in to manage the clinic and take it to new places,\" she said. \"At times it was difficult, particularly last year with the court case and the harassment, but I put that behind me and have concentrated on delivering services for women in Ireland both north and south. \"I think I've achieved a significant historical change in the perception of abortion in Northern Ireland from where the usual narrative was that abortion was illegal in Northern Ireland to now one where people understand that abortion is legal under certain circumstances. \"I think we've challenged the myths and stereotypes that are presented by those who are opposed to a woman's right to chose.\" Genevieve Edwards, director of policy for Marie Stopes UK, said: \"We were so lucky to have Dawn and wish her every success in whatever she chooses to do. \"The support for the clinic since it opened in very challenging circumstances has been heartening and a source of great comfort and pride for our staff and volunteers. \"We are now actively recruiting for Dawn's successor to lead us into the next phase of the clinic's journey.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1},

The dog, a one-year-old Australian sheepdog named Poppy, went with her. Police confirmed that Poppy's barking alerted rescuers to the whereabouts of the pair after a seven-hour search. Rescuers found Sophia and Poppy 200m from a dam on the family's property. The Australian Broadcasting Corp. quoted Sophia's grandmother, Vera Cook, who credited the dog with saving the toddler's life. She said that Sophia was wearing just a nappy and T-shirt when she wandered off. \"The only thing I was thinking was well, hopefully the dog would have kept her warm,\" Ms Cook was quoted as saying. \"If [the dog] wasn't with her, I don't know whether they would have found her.\" The family issued a statement thanking emergency services and promising that Poppy would be \"well fed this evening\".\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\nA pet dog is being credited with keeping a little girl safe after the pair wandered away from their family home and could not be found for hours.\n\n###\nArticle: Sam Smith stole the show at the Grammy Awards, winning four awards as well as performing his hit Stay With Me with Mary J Blige. But Madonna stole much of the attention on the red carpet, showing she is determined not to be overshadowed by the younger pop crowd. The queen of pop later sang Living For Love with a pack of horned male dancers before being lifted to the skies. Australian singer Sia - whose claim to fame is that she does not want to be famous - sang her hit Chandelier while facing the wall (right) while Bridesmaids actress Kristen Wiig and 12-year-old Maddie Ziegler danced in set made to look like a grotty, cluttered flat. Sia had earlier arrived in a conspicuous disguise, accompanied by Ziegler. Pharrell Williams was among the big winners, picking up three trophies as well as performing his song Happy while apparently dressed as a bell boy. When Beck won best album, Kanye West invaded the stage and threatened to launch a tirade, before apparently thinking better of it and going back to his seat. In 2009, he grabbed the microphone from Taylor Swift as she tried to accept a prize at the VMAs. Beck, who also won best rock album, performed a duet with Coldplay's Chris Martin. Taylor Swift got a hand with her dress on the red carpet. She missed out on the awards for record of the year and song of the year. The big-name pair-ups included Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga, who performed Irving Berlin's Cheek To Cheek. Rihanna arrived in a pink layered dress by Giambattista Valli. Katy Perry mingled with fans before swapping fashion tips (possibly) with Rihanna. Perry then changed clothes - and hair - to perform her ballad By the Grace of God as part of a poignant segment highlighting domestic abuse. Kanye West appeared in a single spotlight to perform Only One, which he wrote with Sir Paul McCartney. He later returned with Sir Paul and Rihanna to perform their joint collaboration FourFiveSeconds. Jessie J and Sir Tom Jones, former co-stars on The Voice UK, got together for a duet of You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'. Charli XCX (left) and Iggy Azalea were up for record of the year for their hit Fancy - but lost out to Sam Smith. Beyonce won three awards and also sang the gospel standard Take My Hand, Precious Lord. Rita Ora warmed up for her performance at the Oscars later this month with an appearance at the Grammys. Hard rock legends AC/DC opened the ceremony with Rock or Bust and Highway to Hell. Recalling his Oscar-winning film role in Ray a decade ago, Jamie Foxx (right) got into character as Ray Charles as he joined Stevie Wonder to present the prize for record of the year.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nSam Smith was the big winner at the Grammy Awards, taking home four awards, including song of the year and record of the year.

The firm admitted a Health and Safety Executive (HSE) breach and was fined Â£7,500. It must also pay Â£1,120 costs. The hearing heard how the worker had to have the big toe on his left foot amputated and two other toes removed. He was in hospital for seven days but has since returned to work, the hearing heard.

I had prepared for that but at times there was quite a bit of undue criticism of the team,\" adds the Down boss. \"Whenever I took the job, I lost maybe eight or 10 players and they were the most experienced players in the panel. \"So you are starting from scratch as such. You are having to start and build a panel and you are bringing in young and inexperienced players who might have played at minor and under-21 level. \"There is a massive step up from under-21 to having to play at senior level. But we worked away, we kept our heads down, we introduced quite a few players and the ball is starting to roll in the right direction for us.\" Burns believes the concluding league draw in Cork which kept Down in Division Two as Derry and Fermanagh suffered the drop was a key moment in his team's development. \"We knew we were going to have to get something when we were down there and it had been a long time since Down had got anything in Cork. \"We had a tough second half with them but we battled it out and the result kept us in Division Two and gave us a platform to build on in the lead-in to the championship.\" Despite avoiding the drop to join Armagh in Division Three, Down still went into the Ulster derby against the Orchard County on 4 June as underdogs but the Mournemen produced a composed second-half display to earn a deserved 0-15 to 2-7 victory. \"We knew if we performed on the day that we had a massive chance of beating Armagh.

A UK team has scanned each of its 360 bones into a computer and has digitally reconstructed the dinosaur. The specimen, nicknamed \"Sophie\", has been acquired by the Natural History Museum in London. Although Stegosauruses are one of the most well known dinosaurs, they are among those that scientists know the least about. There are only six partial skeletons of the creature, which lived around 150 million years ago. It could grow to the size of a minibus and the gigantic plates which ran along its back were its most distinctive feature. Surprisingly, it was 100 years ago that the dinosaur's skeleton was properly assessed and scientifically described. Now, using medical imaging techniques and 3D modelling, researchers at the Natural History Museum hope to learn much more about this iconic creature. Prof Paul Barrett, who is leading the research, said that they were particularly interested in finding out what stegosauruses used their plates for. \"We want to find out whether they were used for defence or whether they were used as a radiator to help the animal pick up or lose heat,\" he told BBC News. Sophie is 80% complete and is thought to be the most complete specimen in the world. Dr Charlotte Brassey, who is working with Prof Barrett, helped to scan in its 360 bones and digitally recreate it on her computer as a detailed 3D model. \"I reconstructed the skeleton to see what it might have looked like and then began to reconstruct the muscles and how they connected with the skeleton. From that we can begin to say how effective its muscles were and eventually in the future we would like to reconstruct how it moved,\" she told BBC News. Among the mysteries the researchers would like to solve is how the species was able to walk with such small front legs and such large back legs.

The SMC approved the drug after hearing that patients tended to be younger women with family and work commitments. Cancer Research UK said trials have shown that olaparib can extend lives by an average of seven months. Olaparib is already approved for use in England for people who are suffering with cancer for a third time. In Scotland, it will be used by women who have relapsed with cancer for a second time. Katherine Taylor, chief executive of research charity Ovarian Cancer Action, said: \"The SMC's decision to approve the routine use of olaparib is ground-breaking; a huge leap towards more personalised treatment for women facing ovarian cancer because of a genetic mutation.\" The drug targets ovarian cancer in women with a BRCA 1 or BRCA 2 gene mutation. Last year Angelina Jolie had her ovaries and fallopian tubes removed after she was found to be at an increased risk of ovarian cancer due to a \"faulty\" BRCA 1 gene. Ms Taylor warned that women in Scotland would only qualify for olaparib if their BRCA status is known. She said: \"NHS Scotland must continue to make sure that all patients are offered a BRCA test at diagnosis so they can be treated with the best drugs available.\" Gregor McNie, of Cancer Research UK in Scotland, said the charity was also funding clinical trials to asses the potential for olaparib in the treatment of brain tumours and pancreatic cancer. He added: \"Cancer Research UK scientists played a pivotal role in discovering and developing olaparib and it is great news that the drug will now offer new hope to some women in Scotland with advanced disease. \"We look forward to further good news on olaparib in the future, with clinical trials showing it also has potential in other types of cancer.\" Olaparib was approved by the SMC after being considered by its Patient Clinician Engagement (PACE) process which is used for medicines that treat end of life and very rare conditions. Prof Jonathan Fox, chairman of the SMC, said: \"As the first maintenance treatment for ovarian cancer, olaparib is an important development, and we know from the evidence given by patients and clinicians through our PACE process that it will be welcomed.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nA new drug has been approved for use in Scotland to treat women with ovarian cancer .\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "A", "▁new", "▁drug", "▁has", "▁been", "▁approved", "▁for", "▁use", "▁in", "▁Scotland", "▁to", "▁treat", "▁women", "▁with", "▁o", "var", "ian", "▁cancer", "▁.", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁The", "▁US", "▁government", "▁is", "▁seeking", "▁to", "▁extr", "ad", "ite", "▁a", "▁former", "▁chief", "▁executive", "▁of", "▁a", "▁British", "▁Virgin", "▁Islands", "▁bank", "▁who", "▁is", "▁accused", "▁of", "▁helping", "▁clients", "▁e", "va", "de", "▁tax", "es", "▁.", "▁▁", "▁The", "▁US", "▁government", "▁said"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.006892003118991852, -0.5209261775016785, -0.010453470051288605, -0.49028390645980835, -2.3841855067985307e-07, -0.006742109544575214, -0.05269481986761093, -0.003940319176763296, -0.000615407363511622, -8.821448318485636e-06, -0.05958086997270584, -0.015415564179420471, -0.36561936140060425, -0.0018245016690343618, -0.05028173327445984, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.6673583984375, -0.0041959346272051334, 0.0, -0.11800913512706757, 0.0, 0.0, -2.3841855067985307e-07, 0.0, 0.0, -0.10002733021974564, -1.3678768873214722, -0.29262426495552063, -0.28799980878829956, -1.461761474609375, -0.6985231041908264, -0.37399816513061523, 0.0, 0.0, -0.0023292573168873787, -0.05990416929125786, -0.8382863998413086, -0.14879530668258667, -0.0019524098606780171, -0.06307268142700195, -0.7291014790534973, -0.5268083214759827, -0.0019286142196506262, -0.052144598215818405, -0.09252897650003433, -0.23643788695335388, -0.3650718927383423, -2.3841855067985307e-07, -0.067005954682827, -0.9050347208976746, -0.07754161208868027, 0.0, 0.0, -0.0029448973946273327, -4.529942543740617e-06, -0.27391311526298523, -0.5420688390731812, -0.0812537670135498, -0.004132778849452734, -0.7892793416976929, -0.39280828833580017], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "A": -0.006892003118991852, "▁new": -0.5209261775016785, "▁drug": -0.010453470051288605, "▁has": -0.49028390645980835, "▁been": -2.3841855067985307e-07, "▁approved": -0.006742109544575214, "▁for": -0.05269481986761093, "▁use": -0.003940319176763296, "▁in": -0.000615407363511622, "▁Scotland": -8.821448318485636e-06, "▁to": -0.6985231041908264, "▁treat": -0.015415564179420471, "▁women": -0.36561936140060425, "▁with": -0.0018245016690343618, "▁o": -0.05028173327445984, "var": 0.0, "ian": 0.0, "▁cancer": 0.0, "▁.": -0.27391311526298523, "##": -0.11800913512706757, "#": 0.0, "Art": -2.3841855067985307e-07, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "▁The": -0.0812537670135498, "▁US": -0.004132778849452734, "▁government": -0.7892793416976929, "▁is": -0.23643788695335388, "▁seeking": -1.461761474609375, "▁extr": -0.37399816513061523, "ad": 0.0, "ite": 0.0, "▁a": -0.06307268142700195, "▁former": -0.05990416929125786, "▁chief": -0.8382863998413086, "▁executive": -0.14879530668258667, "▁of": -2.3841855067985307e-07, "▁British": -0.7291014790534973, "▁Virgin": -0.5268083214759827, "▁Islands": -0.0019286142196506262, "▁bank": -0.052144598215818405, "▁who": -0.09252897650003433, "▁accused": -0.3650718927383423, "▁helping": -0.067005954682827, "▁clients": -0.9050347208976746, "▁e": -0.07754161208868027, "va": 0.0, "de": 0.0, "▁tax": -0.0029448973946273327, "es": -4.529942543740617e-06, "▁▁": -0.5420688390731812, "▁said": -0.39280828833580017}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

McColgan said she felt excited to see her last record broken by Muir. She had earlier raised concerns about whether Muir's race had met all the criteria set by UK Athletics for record-breaking attempts. She had told BBC radio's John Beattie programme it needed to be a \"genuine race\" and may not have been as \"Muir had been the only competitor\". \"It was a mixed 3K race where all the other girls ran 3K and it was only Laura who finished the 5K,\" she said. \"We were wondering if to get a record ratified you have to have drug testing as well. \"So we were just wondering if they had everything in place to actually have it ratified as a record.\" However, British Athletics confirmed Muir's time was expected to be classified as official. A spokesman said: \"The time will undergo ratification but is expected to be confirmed\". Rules stipulate that if there is no doping control at an event where a British record is set, there is no requirement for the athlete to submit drug tests. McColgan said Muir had what it took to win world medals. \"To run 14.49 indoors is pretty good,\" she said. \"But she is a 3.55 minute 1,500m runner, so you would expect someone like Laura to run (5K) in something like 14.30. \"So there's still a lot more in the tank and I don't think that's the fastest 5K she's ever going to run. \"She's got the ability to get down to 14.30, which is really mixing it with the top in the world.\" McColgan said Muir's race, which saw her lap other runners, had been similar to her own record-breaking race 25 years ago. \"I ran on my own right from the start with nobody really pushing me at all,\" she said. \"I actually lapped a young Paula Radcliffe about two or three times.\" McColgan said it was a bonus that her record was beaten by a fellow Scot. \"She is world class,\" she said. \"She just needs to get her race tactics right so that she can start winning some medals.\" Muir broke her own British 1500m record at the Diamond League meeting in Paris in August and reached the 1,500m Olympic final at Rio 2016.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nLaura Muir broke Joanna McColgan's 25-year-old British record for the 5,000 meters indoors, clocking 14 minutes, 49.12 seconds at the Emirates Arena in Glasgow on Wednesday .

A suspect appeared in court on Friday and was charged with the murder of the popular goalkeeper. Meyiwa's death shocked South Africa and has highlighted the high rates of violent crime in the country. The funeral took place at the Moses Mabhida Stadium in Meyiwa's hometown of Durban. Many of the mourners were wearing T-shirts with a picture of Meyiwa, who was widely seen as an inspiring figure. Others wore red or black replica football shirts in the colours of Meyiwa's team, Orlando Pirates. Meyiwa's coffin was driven into the stadium, followed by Orlando Pirates players and officials. Mourners cried as videos were played showing Meyiwa training and playing football. Celebrating Senzo Meyiwa's life was the main theme for the tens of thousands of fans who packed into the stands. Fans from his team, the Orlando Pirates, but also from their rivals, the Kaiser Chiefs, sung Senzo's praises - both his ability on the pitch, and his behaviour off it. But there were also posters calling for justice for his killers, and a tougher stance from the South African authorities over gun-related violence. Underlying everything was a sense of injustice that one of Africa's most promising football talents could be killed in such a way. The chairman of the country's football association said he hoped that this could be a \"turning-point\" in the long-running debate over violent crime. And Senzo Meyiwa's father Sam told me he wanted more random searches, to cut the number of guns in South Africa. \"We are no longer safe in our houses,\" he said. \"The entire nation is crying. We have all lost. Our condolences to Orlando Pirates and Bafana Bafana,\" said Durban Mayor James Nxumalo, AFP reported, using a nickname for South Africa's national team. \"Our hearts are bleeding.\" President Zuma ordered the national flag to be flown at half-mast on Saturday to honour the goalkeeper. Following Meyiwa's death, South Africa's domestic football league postponed this weekend's scheduled Johannesburg derby between Orlando Pirates and rivals Kaiser Chiefs. The Durban stadium was also named as the venue for host South Africa's next Africa Cup of Nations qualifier. The funeral of another South African sporting hero, former 800m world champion Mbulaeni Mulaudzi, also took place on Saturday. Mulaudzi was killed in a car accident the day before Meyiwa's death. Police said on Friday that a suspect had been identified in Meyiwa's killing after an identity parade.

The most disadvantaged pupils in Shanghai match the maths test results of wealthy pupils in the UK. Mr Schleicher says it \"debunks the myth that poverty is destiny\". On Monday, Education Secretary Michael Gove said individual schools in England should take Pisa tests, so that they could compare themselves against international standards. The latest Pisa - Programme for International Student Assessment - test results were published last year by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, ranking developed countries in terms of how well 15-year-olds performed in tests in reading, maths and science. Source: OECD This showed the UK as a middle-ranking country, with Asian school systems, such as in Singapore, South Korea and Shanghai and Hong Kong in China, as the highest performers. But Mr Schleicher's latest analysis compares the performance of the most deprived 10% of pupils. This reveals how the poorest in many countries overlap with the results of the wealthy in other countries. The poorest 10% of pupils in Shanghai are as good as the most privileged 20% of teenagers taking the test in the UK and the United States. In Europe, the Netherlands has the highest-performing pupils from the poorest families. Poor pupils in the Netherlands are as good at maths as much better-off teenagers in France. The poorest 10% of pupils in Hong Kong scored at a higher level than the wealthiest in Sweden and Norway. The very lowest performers among this group were in the Slovak Republic. Mr Schleicher says it shows how academic differences attributed to social background should not be unquestioningly tolerated. \"We tend to overestimate the impact of poverty,\" he says . There was also a challenge to the idea that the UK has an unusually poor record on social mobility. Dr John Jerrim at the Institute of Education published a study suggesting that in international terms the UK was mid-ranking in the link between family background and future employment opportunities - 17th out of 34 developed countries. There was greater equity in Scandinavia and some European countries, including Germany and the Netherlands. But Dr Jerrim said social mobility in the UK was not dissimilar to France, Spain and Italy - and the UK's record was better than some central and eastern European countries. \"Policymakers often state that the relationship between family background and labour market earnings is stronger in the UK than most other countries,\" he said. \"It is not true that we stand out compared to the rest of world. Policymakers should avoid making such exaggerated claims when discussing this politically sensitive issue.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nThe UK's poorest pupils are as good at maths as the wealthiest pupils in some Asian countries, according to a new analysis of international test results.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "The", "▁UK", "'", "s", "▁poor", "est", "▁pup", "ils", "▁are", "▁as", "▁good", "▁at", "▁math", "s", "▁as", "▁the", "▁wealth", "iest", "▁pup", "ils", "▁in", "▁some", "▁Asian", "▁countries", ",", "▁according", "▁to", "▁a", "▁new", "▁analysis", "▁of", "▁international", "▁test", "▁results", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁The", "▁UK", "'", "s", "▁poor", "est", "▁pup", "ils", "▁are", "▁as", "▁good", "▁at", "▁math", "s", "▁as", "▁the", "▁wealth", "iest", "▁pup", "ils"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.2704084813594818, -0.02560676820576191, -0.6249268054962158, 0.0, -0.009976169094443321, -0.025925442576408386, -0.0001740304142003879, 0.0, -0.02240266278386116, -0.1839347928762436, -2.074220174108632e-05, -0.252010315656662, 0.0, -4.768370445162873e-07, -2.3841855067985307e-07, -0.27623578906059265, -0.2533290982246399, -0.0002441108226776123, -0.12246108055114746, 0.0, -6.318072337307967e-06, -0.3733811378479004, -0.0037557794712483883, -2.264974000354414e-06, -0.0001586549769854173, -0.01078078243881464, 0.0, -0.010823472402989864, -0.030351491644978523, -0.08633869886398315, -0.23716385662555695, -0.003585103200748563, -0.27782681584358215, -0.0005585778853856027, -0.36115825176239014, -0.15966729819774628, 0.0, -0.0006256530177779496, 0.0, 0.0, -1.1920928244535389e-07, 0.0, 0.0, -0.060394253581762314, -0.31195104122161865, -0.08432400226593018, 0.0, -2.002696055569686e-05, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -1.1920928244535389e-07, 0.0, 0.0, -4.541770613286644e-05, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.0005536930402740836, 0.0, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -7.152555099310121e-07, 0.0], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "The": -0.2704084813594818, "▁UK": -0.31195104122161865, "'": -0.08432400226593018, "s": 0.0, "▁poor": -2.002696055569686e-05, "est": 0.0, "▁pup": -7.152555099310121e-07, "ils": 0.0, "▁are": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "▁as": 0.0, "▁good": 0.0, "▁at": -4.541770613286644e-05, "▁math": 0.0, "▁the": -0.0005536930402740836, "▁wealth": 0.0, "iest": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "▁in": -6.318072337307967e-06, "▁some": -0.3733811378479004, "▁Asian": -0.0037557794712483883, "▁countries": -2.264974000354414e-06, ",": -0.0001586549769854173, "▁according": -0.01078078243881464, "▁to": 0.0, "▁a": -0.010823472402989864, "▁new": -0.030351491644978523, "▁analysis": -0.08633869886398315, "▁of": -0.23716385662555695, "▁international": -0.003585103200748563, "▁test": -0.27782681584358215, "▁results": -0.0005585778853856027, ".": -0.36115825176239014, "##": -0.0006256530177779496, "#": 0.0, "Art": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "▁The": -0.060394253581762314}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

The US central bank also said it expected a \"slower path\" for future rate rises. It raised rates in December for the first time in nearly a decade. On the 23 June UK referendum on whether to stay in the European Union, Ms Yellen said: \"Clearly this is a very important decision for the United Kingdom and for Europe. \"It is a decision that could have consequences for economic and financial conditions in global financial markets. \"If it does so it could have consequences in turn for the US economic outlook that would be a factor in deciding on the appropriate path of policy,\" she added. Meanwhile, the US Treasury cleared all bond sales on the 23 June. Lou Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson ICAP, told Bloomberg Business that the Treasury alters its auctions calendar to avoid Fed monetary policy announcements, and that the UK referendum was a \"similar kind of market event\". Fed policymakers did not reveal when rates might rise, but the door has been left open for an increase when they next meet at the end of July. Chair Yellen added: \"Proceeding cautiously and raising our interest-rate target will allow us to verify that economic growth will return to a moderate pace, that the labor market will strengthen further, and that inflation will continue to make progress toward our 2% objective.\" The Fed said in a statement that the pace of improvement in the labour market had slowed. The bank added, however, that \"economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labour market indicators will strengthen\" even with gradual rate increases. Analysis: Andrew Walker, BBC News The key consideration in this decision was the US jobs market - with a little help from the uncertainties arising from the forthcoming British referendum and a few other factors. We have had two months where job creation has been disappointing, especially May. The Fed Chair Janet Yellen called it \"something of a loss of momentum\". But she also said signs there were signs that the labour market is \"approaching maximum employment\" and it's important not to attach too much importance to one data point. She - and, she said, the Fed's policy making committee - did not feel that \"progress in the labour market has come to an end\". Which leaves us (or at least me) having to pore over the next jobs report to see how likely a rate rise is in July. At this stage it doesn't look very likely, but it is not altogether off the table. The dollar fell against the euro and sterling, but Wall Street held on to earlier gains, with the S&P 500 up 0.3%. The Fed expected the unemployment rate to stand at 4.7% by the end of this year, before falling to 4.6% in 2017 and remain at that level in 2018. In May, US job creation fell to its lowest level in more than five years,\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nThe US Federal Reserve has kept interest rates on hold, but said it expected a \"slower path\" for future rate rises.

Mr Holmes opened fire during the midnight premiere of a Batman film in Aurora, Colorado, in July 2012. Officials say he was wearing body armour, threw smoke canisters and shot at people trying to escape. If the jury finds him not guilty on grounds of insanity, he will spend the rest of his life in a mental institution for the criminally insane. Otherwise he faces the death penalty. During opening statements on Monday, District Attorney George Brauchler said both mental health evaluators agreed on Mr Holmes' mental state at the time of the attack. \"Both of them said the same thing - that the guy was sane when he tried to murder all those people in the theatre,\" he said. Prosecutors have argued the attack was clearly premeditated, with Mr Holmes planning and amassing weapons for months, as well as elaborately booby-trapping his apartment to kill anyone who tried to enter. His parents wrote a letter to the Denver Post in December calling for his life to the spared. Robert and Arlene Holmes said their son was \"not a monster\", but suffers from severe mental illness. The trial comes after two and a half years of complicated legal questions related to the death penalty and the insanity plea, and after nearly three months of jury selection. The mental health evaluations could be a key factor. Judge Carlos Samour ordered a second mental health exam after prosecutors said the first one was biased. Defence lawyers objected to a second test.

It is now returning what remains of the original $20m (Â£13m) donation. Mr Cosby denies any wrongdoing and has not been charged with any crime. The Cosby family donated the money to the women's college in 1988 and the endowed professorship was established in the name of Mr Cosby and his wife, Camille. Mr Cosby, 78, is facing a series of historic sexual assault allegations dating back several decades. Recently released court documents from a 2005 civil case show he had admitted obtaining sedatives to give to women before sex. But Mr Cosby's lawyers said he was only one of many people who introduced the sedatives - Quaaludes - into their \"consensual sex life in the 1970s\". They said that at no point had Mr Cosby admitted to having any non-consensual sex or giving any women drugs without their knowledge. \"Quaaludes were a highly popular recreational drug in the 1970s, labelled in slang as 'disco biscuits', and known for their capacity to increase sexual arousal,\" a statement said. Mr Cosby's legal team is attempting to stop a judge unsealing the full set of documents from the case, including the confidential settlement agreement. More than 12 women have accused Mr Cosby of sexual assault, but he has denied all of the claims. 2002: Lachele Covington, a 20-year-old actress, reportedly files a police report saying she had been inappropriately touched. No further action was taken. 2005: Andrea Constand sues Mr Cosby for sexual assault. The case is eventually settled out of court in 2006. 2014: Over the year, dozens of women make public accusations that Mr Cosby sexually assaulted them. Live shows are cancelled across the country amid protests November 2014: TV network NBC scraps plans for a new show with the comedian following allegations by TV presenter Janice Dickinson that he had assaulted her in 1982. Repeats of the Cosby Show are also pulled from cable TV December 2014: Judy Huth sues Mr Cosby for molesting her in 1974 when she was 15 years old. Mr Cosby counter-sues, claiming she is trying to extort money from him May 2015: Mr Cosby speaks publicly about the allegations for the first time. \"I can't speak; I just don't want to argue; I don't talk about it,\" he told ABC News. July 2015: Court papers made public from Constand's 2005 civil case reveal Mr Cosby admitted obtaining sedatives with the intent of giving them to women he wanted to have sex with.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nA college is returning the remaining $1m (Â£640,000) of a $20m (Â£13m) donation made by Bill Cosby after a series of sexual assault allegations against him emerged.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "A", "▁college", "▁is", "▁returning", "▁the", "▁remaining", "▁$", "1", "m", "▁(", "Â", "£", "6", "4", "0", ",", "0", "0", "0", ")", "▁of", "▁a", "▁$", "2", "0", "m", "▁(", "Â", "£", "1", "3", "m", ")", "▁don", "ation", "▁made", "▁by", "▁Bill", "▁Cos", "by", "▁after", "▁a", "▁series", "▁of", "▁sexual", "▁assault", "▁alleg", "ations", "▁against", "▁him", "▁emer", "ged", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁The", "▁US"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.3700912892818451, -0.7528324127197266, -0.12821996212005615, -0.0001616347290109843, -0.4246663451194763, -0.1705145239830017, -0.775606095790863, -0.5203588008880615, -0.45177948474884033, -0.11741962283849716, 0.0, 0.0, -7.390948667307384e-06, -0.2717595100402832, -0.008231641724705696, -3.576278118089249e-07, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.00016723664884921163, -9.059865078597795e-06, -0.001962760929018259, -2.0265373677830212e-05, 0.0, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -0.0003670972364488989, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -3.576278118089249e-07, 0.0, 0.0, -0.0005540504935197532, 0.0, -0.22431807219982147, -0.0030820509418845177, -0.0007373951375484467, 0.0, 0.0, -0.13717837631702423, -0.7293550968170166, -0.13252811133861542, 0.0, -0.00792359933257103, -2.0861407392658293e-05, -0.000164018536452204, 0.0, -0.12886717915534973, -0.052700474858284, -0.0835665911436081, 0.0, -0.07914970815181732, -0.004448873922228813, 0.0, -0.6935133337974548, 0.0, 0.0, -2.3841830625315197e-06, 0.0, 0.0, -0.07564062625169754, -0.19448710978031158], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "A": -0.3700912892818451, "▁college": -0.7528324127197266, "▁is": -0.12821996212005615, "▁returning": -0.0001616347290109843, "▁the": -0.4246663451194763, "▁remaining": -0.1705145239830017, "▁$": -0.001962760929018259, "1": 0.0, "m": 0.0, "▁(": -0.0003670972364488989, "Â": 0.0, "£": 0.0, "6": -7.390948667307384e-06, "4": -0.2717595100402832, "0": 0.0, ",": -3.576278118089249e-07, ")": 0.0, "▁of": 0.0, "▁a": -0.7293550968170166, "2": -2.0265373677830212e-05, "3": -3.576278118089249e-07, "▁don": -0.0005540504935197532, "ation": 0.0, "▁made": -0.22431807219982147, "▁by": -0.0030820509418845177, "▁Bill": -0.0007373951375484467, "▁Cos": 0.0, "by": 0.0, "▁after": -0.13717837631702423, "▁series": -0.13252811133861542, "▁sexual": -0.00792359933257103, "▁assault": -2.0861407392658293e-05, "▁alleg": -0.000164018536452204, "ations": 0.0, "▁against": -0.12886717915534973, "▁him": -0.052700474858284, "▁emer": -0.0835665911436081, "ged": 0.0, ".": -0.07914970815181732, "##": -0.6935133337974548, "#": 0.0, "Art": -2.3841830625315197e-06, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "▁The": -0.07564062625169754, "▁US": -0.19448710978031158}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

The deal depends on Aermont, which runs property investment funds, securing financing in the next four weeks. Pinewood's 007 stage is one of the world's largest and was used to film parts of Spectre and Skyfall. Some of Star Wars: The Force Awakens was also filmed at Pinewood in Buckinghamshire. However, Harrison Ford, the actor who plays Han Solo, was injured when the door of the Millennium Falcon closed on him and broke his leg. Goodweather Investment Management, which is owned by property investors Peel Holdings, and Warren James Holdings, owner of the eponymous jewellery chain, together control 65% of Pinewood Group and have agreed to the cash sale providing the buyer secures financing. The prospective new owner intends to keep the existing management in place, led by chief executive Ivan Dunleavy. The company has film and TV studios all over the world including in the US, Canada, Malaysia and the Dominican Republic.

As a result, it says it will offer five times more sustainable chocolate in the UK by 2019. But critics warn this could confuse consumers. They also fear that shared standards around ethical trade will be lost if more firms drop Fairtrade. So what prompted Mondelez's change of approach, and does it leave the future of the Fairtrade mark in doubt? Broadly, Fairtrade works as a voluntary certification system which holds adherents to strict standards - in particular paying a minimum price for raw materials such as cocoa, sugar and coffee. But Glenn Caton, northern Europe president at Mondelez, tells the BBC that while his firm and Fairtrade have the same goals, \"sustainability is about much more to us than price\". \"The next generation of farmers aren't taking on cocoa farming like they used to because it is so unprofitable, so we have to make sure their communities thrive and this means investing more in their communities,\" he says. As such, Mondelez wants to lead its own sustainability efforts - investing more in areas such as its supply chain, bonuses for farmers, training and climate change prevention. The Fairtrade Foundation has welcomed the move, too, which it says will leave farmers in developing countries like Ghana at least as well off, if not better-off. \"The relationship is not ending, it's changing,\" says policy and public affairs director Barbara Crowther, pointing out that the Fairtrade Foundation will remain a partner to Cocoa Life - independently assessing its progress and reporting its findings. The big question now is whether other firms will also choose to abandon Fairtrade certification and adopt their own systems of self-regulation. Certainly criticism of the Fairtrade system is mounting in the cocoa industry, says Dr Steve Davies of the Institute of Economic Affairs. The big issue is that most cocoa producers are small farmers who can't achieve the economies of scale of bigger farms, and that leaves many vulnerable to risks like drought and struggling to survive. \"Fairtrade does bring benefits to some producers, but it will not be a way of transforming the world trade system as some people seem to see it,\" he says. \"The only way to improve conditions for people working at bottom of the supply chain - those farming raw materials like cocoa - is by investing in the supply chain. Price floors might help but will only go so far.\" Another issue, says Tobias Webb, of supply chain consultancy the Innovation Forum, is that firms can find the web of overlapping ethical trade certifications out there complex to manage. These include not just Fairtrade's, but the Rainforest Alliance - which is dedicated to the conservation of tropical forests - and UTZ, the world's most prevalent label for sustainable farming. \"Producers can end up putting four or five labels on their products, and achieving each one requires a costly and time consuming audit. \"So many businesses like Mondelez are now moving towards in-house systems where\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nMondelez, the owner of Cadbury, is to bring all Cadbury lines under its existing in-house fair trade scheme, Cocoa Life.

In the end, the list of those wanting to pay respect Castro in person appears to be very short, with some notable allies choosing to send representatives instead. So who is making the trip to Havana? Perhaps most surprisingly, considering the two countries' long friendship, Russian President Vladimir Putin has said he will not be attending. His spokesman said he was too busy to travel to Cuba but that Russia would be sending a representative. Less surprising is US President Barack Obama's decision to stay away. Despite the steps Mr Obama made towards fixing US-Cuban relations, Castro remains a divisive figure - not least for Cuban-Americans who fled his rule. The White House will not send an official delegation, but Mr Obama's pick for ambassador to Cuba, Jeffrey DeLaurentis, and deputy national security adviser, Ben Rhodes, will attend the commemorative event. UK Prime Minister Theresa May, France's President Francois Hollande and German Chancellor Angela Merkel are all staying away. However, they will be sending government representatives. Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry will attend to represent the UK's Labour Party. Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau - whose late father Pierre was friends with Mr Castro - was one of the few Western leaders to release a message of condolences following the leader's death, but will not be attending. Governor-General David Johnston was attending Tuesday's commemoration. China's President Xi Jinping paid his respects at the Cuban embassy in Beijing, saying the country had lost a \"close comrade and real friend\". Vice President Li Yuanchao is representing China at the commemorations in Cuba. Despite their close friendship, Vietnam's President Tran Dai Quang will also not be attending, sending National Assembly chairwoman Nguyen Thi Kim Nga in his place. The country will be holding a national day of mourning for Castro, however. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi - who paid tribute to an \"iconic\" world leader last week - will be sending his home minister but will not be flying to Cuba himself. North Korea's Kim Jung-un will not be travelling to Cuba either, sending a delegation on his behalf. The list of world leaders actually attending is relatively short. A number of South American leaders will be making the trip: Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro, whose late mentor Hugo Chavez had a special bond with Castro, Ecuador's Rafael Correa, Bolivia's Evo Morales and Nicaragua's Daniel Ortega have all indicated they will attend. Also expected are Salvadorean President Salvador Sanchez Ceren and Mexico's President Enrique Pena Nieto. At least two southern African presidents will also fly to Cuba, South Africa's Jacob Zuma, who has just survived a vote of confidence, and Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe, whose country has just brought in a new currency. And it seems the European Union may be represented by just one leader, in the form of Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras.

The company's shares closed the day more than 9% higher. \"We were expecting Netflix to go everywhere, but this has happened more quickly than we thought,\" commented Fernando Elizalde from the tech consultancy Gartner. \"Until now, the firm had been doing it in phased stages because of the costs of marketing and dubbing or subtitling the content. \"But it's worth remembering that in some of the emerging economies it will only be people in urban areas that will be able to use it because of limited internet availability.\" Mr Hastings said Netflix was in talks with the Chinese government, but acknowledged it would take time to reach an agreement. \"It's a very large country, you know a billion Chinese that we want to give access to the Netflix content,\" he said. \"In China you need specific permission from the government to operate, so we are continuing to work on that and we are very patient.\" But one company watcher had doubts. \"China is going to be a tough nut to crack given that that three strong domestic services already exist,\" said Mike Goodman from Strategy Analytics. As part of its expansion, Netflix has added support for Korean, Chinese and Arabic to its list of supported languages. That brings the total number - in which the firm provides subtitles, captions and alternative audio - to 21 languages. Mr Hastings added that Netflix would initially focus on expanding the reach of its existing content rather than commissioning extra locally-made shows. For consumers who already have Netflix, the biggest change may be the addition of HDR. High dynamic range video allows compatible TVs to show millions more colours and a wider dynamic range - added shades of brightness in between black and white - letting more detail be shown. Many experts believe the impact is greater than that of just jumping from 1080p to 4K ultra-high definition resolution alone. One consequence of using the format, however, is that it requires more data, and few TVs support it yet. Mr Hastings said users with compatible TVs should get a \"visceral sensation that's pretty amazing\". The firm's rival, Amazon, began streaming a limited number of shows in the format in 2015. Audience members at the Las Vegas event were also given a first look at some of the service's forthcoming shows, including: Ironically, the clips were blocked for those watching a live stream of the event. The firm also teased Chelsea Does..., a documentary series presented by the comedian Chelsea Handler that will cover topics including drugs, racism, marriage and Silicon Valley.

He faced smuggling charges but was found guilty of a lesser charge of 'endangering life' because he hid the girl in an unsafe way in a van. Lawrie will have to pay the 1,000-euro (Â£754) fine if convicted of another offence. The decision was met with applause from supporters in the courtroom. The former carpet cleaner, who disclosed he had bipolar disorder and Tourette's Syndrome, said he acted \"stupidly\". Before the case started he appeared with the child on his lap at a media conference in the French town. Lawrie said he feared \"being made an example of\" by the court. He told the assembled media: \"They see the media attention I have been getting and I think it could go one of two ways. \"France has an opportunity to show, as I know they are, a compassionate country.\" Lawrie said he regretted his actions and would not repeat the effort. He told the court he had acted stupidly and irrationally in hiding Bru in the sleeping compartment. Speaking via an interpreter, he told the judge: \"I saw the little girl and her father in the work that I was doing. That night I just could not leave her there any more. \"It was wrong. It was the most stupid conceived plan.\" Lawrie rejected the idea that he was trafficking for money, telling the judge: \"Her father is a farmer from Afghanistan. He doesn't have any money whatsoever.\" The aid worker was stopped in Calais as he returned home in October 2015. The former Army physical training instructor said he was helping build shelters in The Jungle camp when he got to know Bru and her father asked him to help get her to close family members living legally in Leeds. He said he was not a hero but \"an unemployed carpet cleaner from Leeds\" who wanted to help and had never been in trouble before. He told reporters his actions had left him penniless and on the edge of bankruptcy after giving up to Â£8,000 of his own money as well as collecting donations for the refugees. He was caught when British sniffer dogs found two Eritrean men who, unbeknown to him, had also stowed in the back of his van. Speaking outside the courtroom, Lawrie said that he had had a heavy weight on his shoulders but now felt \"light\" and would continue fighting to get help for child refugees in The Jungle. He said: \"I'm going to have a few days off and then I'm going to raise the profile (of refugees) even more because we cannot simply leave these children. \"We need to get these children now and into our education system because these guys are going to be doctors and lawyers and teachers if we get them now and educate them correctly. \"Or we can leave them in The Jungle to rot and die of cold.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nA British aid worker who tried to smuggle a young Afghan girl into the UK has been found guilty of endangering her life but cleared of smuggling charges .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "A", "▁British", "▁aid", "▁worker", "▁who", "▁tried", "▁to", "▁sm", "ug", "gle", "▁a", "▁young", "▁Afghan", "▁girl", "▁into", "▁the", "▁UK", "▁has", "▁been", "▁found", "▁guilty", "▁of", "▁end", "ang", "ering", "▁her", "▁life", "▁but", "▁cleared", "▁of", "▁sm", "ugg", "ling", "▁charges", "▁.", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.0012731788447126746, -0.11166774481534958, -0.010169949382543564, 0.0, -0.1257525235414505, -0.1564001441001892, 0.0, -0.030132781714200974, 0.0, 0.0, -0.002924334490671754, -0.7680258750915527, -0.010930543765425682, -0.010172898881137371, -0.04245632514357567, -3.158996332786046e-05, -0.0013017522869631648, -0.12709005177021027, -0.00027771908207796514, -0.5571479201316833, -0.0008386432309634984, -7.152555099310121e-07, -0.7139778733253479, 0.0, 0.0, -0.08073586225509644, -3.6954811548639555e-06, -0.4339868128299713, -0.0019820346496999264, -1.2993727978027891e-05, -0.9853981733322144, 0.0, 0.0, -0.00472239451482892, -0.02332429401576519, -0.008185884915292263, 0.0, -0.11519438028335571, -0.0003259842633269727, -0.0010240792762488127, -3.1470757676288486e-05, -0.00039843725971877575, -2.1457441107486375e-05, -1.1086402082582936e-05, -4.410734163684538e-06, -4.0531076592742465e-06, -2.622600959512056e-06, -1.6689286894688848e-06, -1.0728830375228426e-06, -1.0728830375228426e-06, -7.152555099310121e-07, -1.0728830375228426e-06, -7.152555099310121e-07, -3.576278118089249e-07, -2.3841855067985307e-07, -2.3841855067985307e-07, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -1.1920928244535389e-07, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "A": -0.0012731788447126746, "▁British": -0.11166774481534958, "▁aid": -0.010169949382543564, "▁worker": 0.0, "▁who": -0.1257525235414505, "▁tried": -0.1564001441001892, "▁to": 0.0, "▁sm": -0.9853981733322144, "ug": 0.0, "gle": 0.0, "▁a": -0.002924334490671754, "▁young": -0.7680258750915527, "▁Afghan": -0.010930543765425682, "▁girl": -0.010172898881137371, "▁into": -0.04245632514357567, "▁the": -3.158996332786046e-05, "▁UK": -0.0013017522869631648, "▁has": -0.12709005177021027, "▁been": -0.00027771908207796514, "▁found": -0.5571479201316833, "▁guilty": -0.0008386432309634984, "▁of": -1.2993727978027891e-05, "▁end": -0.7139778733253479, "ang": 0.0, "ering": 0.0, "▁her": -0.08073586225509644, "▁life": -3.6954811548639555e-06, "▁but": -0.4339868128299713, "▁cleared": -0.0019820346496999264, "ugg": 0.0, "ling": 0.0, "▁charges": -0.00472239451482892, "▁.": -0.02332429401576519}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

At a meeting of the Association of Chief Police Officers in January, it was announced that 37 out of 44 forces had signed up to the new system. Critics say the rules are a money-making exercise and allow law breaking. Previously, only those travelling at up to 10% above the limit plus 6mph could be offered one of the courses. But the amendments were agreed by chief constables at a meeting of the Association of Chief Police Officers in January. For a 30mph zone, the upper limit for a speeding course would be 42mph. This would rise to 86mph for motorways and other major roads, although the official limit remains the same. Acpo said the figure at which a course could be offered was a decision for individual forces, and not all would make it available for higher speeds. Drivers can only attend one speed awareness course, costing between Â£60 and Â£100, in a three-year period. \"There is evidence to show that if people are sent on educational courses, rather than being punished with a fine and penalty points on their driving licence, they are less likely to reoffend in the future,\" an Acpo spokeswoman said. \"Clearly if someone is breaking the speed limit outside a school when the children are coming out at 3.15pm, it's a no brainer and they would be punished. But if it is 3am and there's no-one on the streets, there is a degree of discretion.\" But Joel Hickman, spokesman for road safety charity Brake, said the new proposals \"sent out the wrong message\" and were \"simply a way of making money\" - a charge denied by Road Safety Minister Mike Penning. \"Many people drive for work and would rather pay Â£100 to go on a course than accumulate points and risk losing their licence, so it is quite clear which is the greater deterrent to speeding,\" said Mr Hickman. \"It sends out a message that it's ok to speed, which it certainly is not. Speeding causes tragedy every day on British roads and results in a huge number of people being killed and seriously injured. It's also a factor in a quarter of all crashes. \"If you hit a child at 30mph, it's the equivalent of that child falling out of a three storey building. Driving at 42mph would mean that child having no chance of survival.\" But Mr Penning insisted road safety is the government's \"top priority\". \"We support the targeted use of educational courses where these are shown to have a positive effect,\" he said. \"The police are responsible for the administration of these courses but we are clear that course fees should not be used to raise revenue.\" 'Get-out-of-jail-free card?' The Institute of Advanced Motorists said it supported \"the widening of the bandwidths that allow drivers to choose a speed awareness course over a fine\". \"We don't feel it gives a 'get-out-of-jail-free card' - drivers can only attend one speed\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nThe UK government has widened the speeding bandwidths that allow drivers to choose a speed awareness course over a fine.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "The", "▁UK", "▁government", "▁has", "▁w", "iden", "ed", "▁the", "▁speed", "ing", "▁band", "width", "s", "▁that", "▁allow", "▁drivers", "▁to", "▁choose", "▁a", "▁speed", "▁aw", "aren", "ess", "▁course", "▁over", "▁a", "▁fine", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁The", "▁", "3", "8", "-", "year", "-", "old", "▁man", "▁was", "▁arrested", "▁in", "▁the", "▁early", "▁hours", "▁of", "▁Sunday", "▁morning", "▁in", "▁the", "▁town", "▁of", "▁B", "red", "a", ",", "▁in"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.12352374941110611, -0.052911702543497086, -5.8887653722194955e-05, -0.2524908781051636, -1.0206806659698486, 0.0, 0.0, -4.768370445162873e-07, -0.19686603546142578, -0.29674938321113586, -0.620734453201294, -0.01128316018730402, -0.0016675388906151056, -0.21836847066879272, -7.724463648628443e-05, -0.0003649522550404072, 0.0, -0.0006164796068333089, -7.390948667307384e-06, -1.0728830375228426e-06, 0.0, 0.0, -0.00292397802695632, 0.0, -3.576278118089249e-07, 0.0, 0.0, -0.18164187669754028, -0.6999013423919678, 0.0, -0.02390829101204872, 0.0, 0.0, -1.1920928244535389e-07, 0.0, 0.0, -0.05356907844543457, -0.5855475068092346, -0.3017627000808716, -0.49169617891311646, -0.03556792810559273, 0.0, -0.0019287331961095333, 0.0, -0.7775766849517822, -0.0610945038497448, -0.27871283888816833, -0.5620871782302856, -0.07747697085142136, -0.5724495053291321, -0.00024029705673456192, -2.3841830625315197e-06, -0.46654409170150757, -0.008067877031862736, -0.6397814154624939, -0.020594336092472076, -0.45375579595565796, -0.004555205814540386, -1.249177098274231, -1.0889960527420044, -0.0002494739310350269, -0.12132812291383743, -0.07101365178823471], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "The": -0.12352374941110611, "▁UK": -0.052911702543497086, "▁government": -5.8887653722194955e-05, "▁has": -0.2524908781051636, "▁w": -1.0206806659698486, "iden": 0.0, "ed": 0.0, "▁the": -0.020594336092472076, "▁speed": -1.0728830375228426e-06, "ing": -0.29674938321113586, "▁band": -0.620734453201294, "width": -0.01128316018730402, "s": -0.0016675388906151056, "▁that": -0.21836847066879272, "▁allow": -7.724463648628443e-05, "▁drivers": -0.0003649522550404072, "▁to": 0.0, "▁choose": -0.0006164796068333089, "▁a": 0.0, "▁aw": 0.0, "aren": 0.0, "ess": -0.00292397802695632, "▁course": 0.0, "▁over": -3.576278118089249e-07, "▁fine": 0.0, ".": -0.18164187669754028, "##": -0.02390829101204872, "#": 0.0, "Art": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "▁The": -0.05356907844543457, "▁": -0.5855475068092346, "3": -0.3017627000808716, "8": -0.49169617891311646, "-": -0.0019287331961095333, "year": 0.0, "old": 0.0, "▁man": -0.7775766849517822, "▁was": -0.0610945038497448, "▁arrested": -0.27871283888816833, "▁in": -0.07101365178823471, "▁early": -0.5724495053291321, "▁hours": -0.00024029705673456192, "▁of": -0.004555205814540386, "▁Sunday": -0.46654409170150757, "▁morning": -0.008067877031862736, "▁town": -0.45375579595565796, "▁B": -1.249177098274231, "red": -1.0889960527420044, "a": -0.0002494739310350269, ",": -0.12132812291383743}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

Gavin Chambers, an RSPB warden, tweeted pictures of vivid green in the sky over Lake Vyrnwy in Powys, Wales, saying: \"Well worth getting back out of bed for!!\" Donna Butcher tweeted: \"Just been watching an amazing display of Aurora from Staveley, Cumbria. Shafts of light streaming directly towards Polaris.\" You can email your pictures and video to yourpics@bbc.co.uk, and find out more about the Northern Lights here.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\nThere have been spectacular displays of the Aurora Borealis - better known as the Northern Lights - across parts of the UK overnight.\n\n###\nArticle: The astronomer, who presented The Sky At Night for over 50 years, died at his home in Selsey, West Sussex, in December 2012.

The dog, a one-year-old Australian sheepdog named Poppy, went with her. Police confirmed that Poppy's barking alerted rescuers to the whereabouts of the pair after a seven-hour search. Rescuers found Sophia and Poppy 200m from a dam on the family's property. The Australian Broadcasting Corp. quoted Sophia's grandmother, Vera Cook, who credited the dog with saving the toddler's life. She said that Sophia was wearing just a nappy and T-shirt when she wandered off. \"The only thing I was thinking was well, hopefully the dog would have kept her warm,\" Ms Cook was quoted as saying. \"If [the dog] wasn't with her, I don't know whether they would have found her.\" The family issued a statement thanking emergency services and promising that Poppy would be \"well fed this evening\".\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\nA pet dog is being credited with keeping a little girl safe after the pair wandered away from their family home and could not be found for hours.\n\n###\nArticle: The taxi-app firm said the sackings related to sexual harassment, bullying and issues about poor company culture. Uber has been under fire over its treatment of women staff since a former employee wrote a scathing blog post about her experience. It led to two investigations and the uncovering of 215 complaints about harassment and other allegations. Uber has struggled with a series of controversies in recent months, including a backlash over aggressive corporate tactics and a lawsuit from Google-owner Alphabet over allegedly stolen technology for self-driving cars. Several high-placed executives resigned amid the turbulence, including a former head of engineering, who had failed to disclose harassment complaints at his former employer. Chief executive Travis Kalanick's filmed argument with an Uber driver over falling rates also fuelled criticism, leading him to say that he needed \"leadership help\". Susan Fowler, who wrote the critical blog post about Uber, said the company had ignored her complaints of sexual harassment. Widely shared, the blog prompted Mr Kalanick to launch the investigations. Does Silicon Valley have a sexism problem? Uber's mess reaches beyond sexism - and Silicon Valley Law firm Perkins Coie reviewed 215 claims, which included sexual harassment and discrimination as well as other complaints, an Uber spokeswoman said. The firm recommended no action in 100 of them; 57 remain under review, while others have received warnings or are in training, she said. Some of those fired held senior positions, she said. Discrimination, 54; Sexual harassment, 47; Unprofessional behaviour, 45; Bullying, 33; Other harassment, 19; Retaliation, 13; Physical security 3; Wrongful dismissal 1. Staff fired, 20; Staff put in training, 31; Final warnings, 7; Claims still under review, 57. Uber has also appointed Eric Holder, who served as attorney general under former US president Barack Obama, to investigate the company's broader culture. The findings of that report have been turned over to the board and recommendations are expected to be made public next week. Some changes are already in place. Uber announced the hiring of two women to high profile positions this week. Frances Frei, a Harvard Business School professor, will serve as a senior vice president for leadership and strategy, working with the head of human resources Liane Hornsey. Ms Hornsey is herself relatively new, starting at the company in January. Bozoma Saint John, a former marketing executive at Apple, is also joining Uber as chief brand officer. Uber employs more than 12,000 people globally. About 36% of the workforce is female, according to a diversity report the firm published earlier this year. Women hold about 15% of the technology positions. It goes without saying that this issue doesn't go away with these firings. Uber has major questions still to answer - some of them will hopefully be addressed when more details of the report are made public. Most troubling is why Uber's own internal HR measures weren't thorough or fair enough to see that the actions of 20 employees warranted dismissal. Instead it took a brave former employee - and then an expensive, lengthy investigation - to get to that point.

Five competitions between them, five golds won. As of Tuesday night, had the couple been a country they would have sat 13th on the medal table, above Jamaica, Kenya and Brazil. That would be to misunderstand what makes them tick. This is a couple who got engaged while on the sofa watching an episode of EastEnders. You might think too that it would get competitive around the breakfast table in the cottage they share just outside Knutsford in Cheshire. Kenny now has six Olympic golds from three Games, more than Sir Steve Redgrave and Sir Bradley Wiggins. Trott has four, more than any other British woman, and from one fewer Olympics. That would be to misjudge their relationship. Cycling superstars on their own, together they can be almost ordinary, almost invisible. After the gold rush, after their tearful embrace in the Rio velodrome with the world watching on, that may be about to change. \"The difference in their characters is what makes it work for them,\" says Trott's father Adrian. \"Until he gets to know you, Jason is a little bit shy. He's quiet and understated. Laura is bubbly, chatty, just as you see in her interviews. \"If they were both like Jason, God only knows how they'd talk about anything. And God forbid having two Lauras in a household!\" The relationship between the two began in the build-up to London 2012, with Kenny about to come out of Chris Hoy's muscled shadow at his second Olympics and Trott about to experience her first. \"I remember seeing Laura at the velodrome years ago,\" says Kenny's mother Lorraine. \"I said to my husband, 'Flipping heck, you need to watch this young lady.' She was in the elimination race, only a tiny thing, and she kept sprinting over the top of everyone. She was amazing. \"The first time I knew something was happening between the two of them was when Jason phoned me up and said, 'I'm bringing Trotty home for a bacon butty.' \"I said to him, 'Is she your girlfriend?' 'No, she's just a friend.' \"She made herself at home straight away. Into the house, sat down, feet up on the sofa. \"We liked her from the off. She's a girly girl, so I can talk make-up and clothes to her. It's such a treat - having had two sons, I've had years of remote-control cars and standing out in the rain, and at last I can talk to someone about posh shoes.\" Trott and Kenny are not the first couple to both win Olympic golds. Some (Steffi Graf, ladies' singles 1988, Andre Agassi, men's singles 1996) have carried more global renown. Others have also won gold in the same sport at the same Games, most recently triathletes Jan Frodeno and Emma Snowsill at Beijing in 2008. But no-one at a summer Games has more. No-one else gets even close. Neither has the British duo finished. Trott is 24, Kenny 28.

The country had a lone shining moment with Girisha Hosanagara Nagarajegowda's silver medal in Men's High Jump F42 class for athletes with an impairment that affects their arms or legs. And deservedly the nation cherished Girisha's feat as medals have generally eluded India's Paralympians. But now questions are being raised at the country's ability to translate the congratulatory tone into awareness of disabled rights. India is not known for being friendly towards the disabled and most public places still lack basic facilities to help them in everyday life.ã€€ 'Second-class' citizens Even before Girisha won his medal, Indian media was abuzz with stories about problems at the Athletes' Village. Several athletes complained that the Paralympics Committee of India had failed to book accommodation for escorts and coaches at the facility. This made the lives of the athletes very tough as they were denied precious time with their coaches. Taking to CNN-IBN, weightlifter Farman Basha said his preparation was severely affected because he could not move freely in the village without his escort. \"I was confident of a medal and now all my training has gone in vain,\" he said. The channel's editor, Rajdeep Sardesai, ran a special show to discuss whether India treats its Paralympians as second-class citizens. Many other channels and newspapers followed suit. It's an irony that the controversy received more coverage than the Games themselves. India may have won just one medal, but the Games were full of inspiring stories. The media seems to have clearly missed a chance to tell these stories to Indians in detail.ã€€ Speaking on the CNN-IBN show, Olympic silver medallist Rajyawardhan Singh Rathod said he was not surprised with the treatment of India's Paralympians. He said much needs to be changed to give equal rights to Paralympians and millions of disabled people in India. \"It's an over-all attitude shift that we need to bring about in our country,\" he said. There is another thread to the story that the India media seems to have missed. The Indian contingent at the Paralympics did not have a single female athlete. While officials say this boils down to qualification woes, the problem runs much deeper. Most schools and colleges lack basic sporting facilities for the disabled and the ones which do rarely encourage disabled women to participate.ã€€ While stories about the controversy continue to make headlines, nobody can take anything away from Girisha. The athlete certainly fought against the odds to make sure India did not return home from London empty handed. He hails from the south Indian state of Karnataka and belongs to an average middle class family. But his determination to win a medal set him apart from others. His training in Bangalore took place away from the glare of the media and fan recognition. With support from an NGO and government, Girisha quit his bank job six months ago to concentrate on training. Today the result is there for everyone to see.

In one, the prime minister apologises to all homosexuals living in Uganda and gives his support to a gay pride march. Homosexual acts are illegal in Uganda and gay people have faced physical attacks and social rejection. Earlier this year, a controversial anti-gay bill, which proposes to increase the penalties for homosexual acts from 14 years in jail to life, was re-tabled in the Ugandan parliament. The bill was first introduced in 2009 but never debated - and the MP backing the legislation says a clause proposing the death penalty will be dropped. It originally said those found guilty of \"aggravated homosexuality\" - defined as when one of the participants is a minor, HIV-positive, disabled or a \"serial offender\" - would face the death penalty. The Uganda Justice Law and Order Sector website was also reportedly taken over by hackers this week. Ambrose Ruyooka, commissioner for the Information Communications Technology ministry, told the BBC the problem had now been rectified. The government has created a directorate of security for all government websites and tightened cyber laws to counter rising cyber crime, he said. An activist named @DramaSett3r on Twitter is said to be behind the attacks. The operations were carried out by a group known as The Elite Society and the Anonymous hacktivist community, the activist said. On Wednesday, the official website of Prime Minister Amama Mbabazi quoted him as saying: \"We have got to expel the narrow mindedness from this country, and begin afresh, starting with a full and formal apology to all homosexuals living in Uganda today,\" screen grabs on Twitter and Facebook show. A message allegedly posted by the hackers on the prime minister's site on Tuesday said: \"Your violations of the rights of LGBT [lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender] people have disgusted us. \"All people have the right to live in dignity free from the repression of someone else's political and religious beliefs.\" The East African nation is a largely conservative society and many people condemn homosexuality both as unAfrican and unChristian.

The researchers studied a group of hazel dormice in Denbighshire as part of the project. It found some dormice breed before they are one year old. The research also established that some produce two litters in a year, which was known behaviour in continental European mice but had never been observed in the UK before. The study is the longest and largest of its kind in the UK. Chester Zoo's biodiversity officer Sarah Bird said: \"Promiscuity in females had never been recorded before; and it will increase genetic diversity within litters, helping population survival. \"Equally important are the other breeding behaviours we have seen. \"It is likely that those years when females breed twice, and the young of the year also breed, is when populations can really increase. \"These behaviours are likely to be critical for healthy sustainable dormouse populations in the UK.\" Hazel dormice are protected under European law. The numbers of dormice and the range of the species have both been in decline since recording of the animals and their habitat began in 1990. However the Denbighshire site at Bontuchel, near Ruthin, showed a large, stable population of dormice. \"Our survey site in north Wales is on the very north western edge of their European range and, from the very start, we've been surprised by how many hazel dormice are there,\" Ms Bird explained. \"That's why it's a very important project and a very important site for study, to understand why this woodland is so good for dormice.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nA study of hazel dormice in Wales has found that some females breed before they are one year old, and that some produce two litters in a year.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "A", "▁study", "▁of", "▁ha", "zel", "▁d", "orm", "ice", "▁in", "▁Wales", "▁has", "▁found", "▁that", "▁some", "▁females", "▁bre", "ed", "▁before", "▁they", "▁are", "▁one", "▁year", "▁old", ",", "▁and", "▁that", "▁some", "▁produce", "▁two", "▁lit", "ters", "▁in", "▁a", "▁year", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁The", "▁", "2", "0", "1", "8", "▁Winter", "▁Olympics", "▁will", "▁take", "▁place", "▁from", "▁", "4", "▁to", "▁", "2", "0", "▁February", "▁in"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.08068450540304184, -0.29007577896118164, -0.17704680562019348, -0.3173689842224121, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.08126816153526306, -0.00264021591283381, -0.0006881968001835048, -0.03705456852912903, -0.03015071153640747, -0.03826172649860382, -0.03702378273010254, -0.0838908851146698, 0.0, -0.17569699883460999, -2.9802276912960224e-06, -8.880697714630514e-05, -0.2519359886646271, -7.116541382856667e-05, 0.0, -0.20266006886959076, -0.0007122601964510977, -0.5608882904052734, -0.0031832996755838394, -0.015451835468411446, 0.0, 0.0, -5.602820692729438e-06, -0.07890572398900986, -0.0012848464539274573, -3.6954811548639555e-06, -0.04596734791994095, -0.0008823553798720241, 0.0, -3.0278701160568744e-05, 0.0, 0.0, -1.1920928244535389e-07, 0.0, 0.0, -0.11947426944971085, -0.34909480810165405, -0.5387538075447083, -0.020497171208262444, -0.00766183715313673, -0.29052862524986267, -0.2764895260334015, -0.00010477947944309562, -0.8170017004013062, -0.01586669310927391, 0.0, -0.3655855357646942, -0.02324940636754036, -0.006716533098369837, -0.05493218079209328, 0.0, -0.00036459474358707666, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -1.6689286894688848e-06, -0.36127978563308716], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "A": -0.08068450540304184, "▁study": -0.29007577896118164, "▁of": -0.17704680562019348, "▁ha": -0.3173689842224121, "zel": 0.0, "▁d": 0.0, "orm": 0.0, "ice": 0.0, "▁in": -0.36127978563308716, "▁Wales": -0.00264021591283381, "▁has": -0.0006881968001835048, "▁found": -0.03705456852912903, "▁that": -0.5608882904052734, "▁some": -0.0031832996755838394, "▁females": -0.03702378273010254, "▁bre": -0.0838908851146698, "ed": 0.0, "▁before": -0.17569699883460999, "▁they": -2.9802276912960224e-06, "▁are": -8.880697714630514e-05, "▁one": -0.2519359886646271, "▁year": -3.6954811548639555e-06, "▁old": 0.0, ",": -0.20266006886959076, "▁and": -0.0007122601964510977, "▁produce": -0.015451835468411446, "▁two": 0.0, "▁lit": 0.0, "ters": -5.602820692729438e-06, "▁a": -0.0012848464539274573, ".": -0.04596734791994095, "##": -3.0278701160568744e-05, "#": 0.0, "Art": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "▁The": -0.11947426944971085, "▁": 0.0, "2": -0.00036459474358707666, "0": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "1": -0.00766183715313673, "8": -0.29052862524986267, "▁Winter": -0.2764895260334015, "▁Olympics": -0.00010477947944309562, "▁will": -0.8170017004013062, "▁take": -0.01586669310927391, "▁place": 0.0, "▁from": -0.3655855357646942, "4": -0.006716533098369837, "▁to": -0.05493218079209328, "▁February": -1.6689286894688848e-06}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

At the party's weekly press briefing, I asked the Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies, who was elected on the list, whether he'd stand as a constituency candidate in his home turf of the Vale of Glamorgan but he said he hadn't thought about it. Presumably those are the kind of decisions they will now feel more confident contemplating. The party will also have a huge amount of new data on voters which it'll be able to call upon and the belief that campaigning hard on the NHS helped the Tories cross the line in places like the Vale of Clwyd and Gower. The Conservatives feel it's them, rather than any of the other opposition parties, who have become the repository of votes from those who are disaffected by the state of the NHS. Welsh Labour are going to hold a \"short sharp\" analysis into what went wrong. Carwyn Jones was in line with most of the criticism of Ed Miliband when he told AMs that the party needed to appeal to small business owners who are not millionaires but who work hard. What will be more difficult is countering the argument on the NHS, which the former minister Alun Davies believes is already lost. Another potential difficulty for Welsh Labour will be dealing with unhappiness within the party over council re-organisation. Bernie Attridge, the deputy leader of Flintshire Council, has tweeted saying the party needs to be careful on local government reform if it wants to retain the support of grassroots councillors. It also seems to have been the case that Labour lost more votes to UKIP than the Conservatives, which is another challenge to overcome. But Labour will at least have the advantage that it will be David Cameron, and not Ed Miliband, carrying out the latest round of public sector cuts that are likely to take effect sooner rather than later. The question is whether Carwyn Jones is going to be able to turn that to his advantage when his own record in government will be under scrutiny. Plaid Cymru's education spokesman, Simon Thomas, also in the party's weekly press briefing, said he believed Leanne Wood could portray herself as an alternative first minister because of the way she emotionally connected with people in the campaign. The party now has a year to make that a credible proposition after it failed to gain any new seats and came fourth, behind UKIP, in the overall share of the vote, despite her unprecedented profile. He also said that on the campaign trail people wanted to know what Plaid was going to do about the NHS and that people \"did not see the strengths\" of its arguments. The Welsh Liberal Democrats are still licking their wounds but in a \"je ne regrette rien\" moment, the leader Kirsty Williams said she had no regrets over the coalition. She has admitted the party failed to communicate\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nThe Conservatives have been given a huge confidence boost and will feel in a position to challenge in more constituencies next year, rather than just on the list.

The committee's vote clears the way for the bill to go to the upper house of parliament for final approval. The opposition says it will continue to try to delay the vote. The bill would allow Japan to defend its allies overseas even when it is not under attack. The bill is not widely supported by the country at large. Thousands of protesters rallied outside the parliament in Tokyo as the committee debate was under way. Opposition lawmakers tried to physically prevent the debate from taking place. In rare heated scenes, jostling members of the upper house surrounded the chairman of the security committee, Yoshitada Konoike, as he opened the debate on Wednesday and again on Thursday morning as the vote was taking place. The opposition had also tabled a no-confidence vote against Mr Konoike. Wednesday night's session was abandoned in the early hours of Thursday after opposition lawmakers blocked entry to a room where Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and other ministers were waiting to discuss the bill. The bill has already been approved by the government-dominated lower house. It is expected to be passed in the upper house because the ruling coalition has a majority there - this was why opponents were keen to prevent the committee from approving the legislation. It is thought Mr Abe's government wants to pass the bills before the country goes into a five-day holiday on Saturday, which could provide an opportunity for even bigger protests. If the upper house does not pass the bills within 60 days, they will have to be returned the lower house. It is a step Mr Abe is thought to be willing to take. His Liberal Democratic Party-led bloc has a two-thirds majority in the lower chamber, the House of Representatives. Despite his majorities in both houses, the controversial bills, and Mr Abe's determination to push them through despite vocal opposition, appear to have damaged his popularity. Polls have consistently shown a majority of the public are opposed to the changes, and relatively few strongly support them. Japan's post-World War Two constitution bars it from using force to resolve conflicts except in cases of self-defence. Mr Abe's government has pushed for security legislation that would allow Japan's military to mobilise overseas when these three conditions are met: What's behind Japan's military shift? The government says Japan needs to pass the bills, which are welcomed by the US, to ensure regional peace and security in the face of rising Chinese assertiveness. It also says they will allow the country to participate more widely in global peacekeeping missions. But opponents say the legislation violates Japan's post-war pacifist constitution, and could lead to it being dragged into US-led conflicts. Despite the likelihood of eventual defeat, opposition to the bills has been credited with helping reverse decades of youth disengagement from politics in Japan. Students in particular, have been closely involved in leading protests once dominated by trade unionists\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nJapanese lawmakers have approved a bill that would allow the country's military to fight abroad for the first time since World War Two.

It comes after Theresa May suggested Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn had not done enough to condemn abuse. The PM has called for parties to unite against \"bullying and harassment\". Since last month's general election, attention has focused on abuse suffered by MPs from across the political spectrum, including Tory Sheryll Murray who said she had faced social media comments like \"burn the witch\". On Saturday, Labour MP Yvette Cooper said some of her party's supporters had targeted female Conservative MPs - as well as Labour members - with \"vitriolic abuse\". But ahead of the Parliamentary debate, Labour has levelled accusations against the Tories in a letter to Conservative Party chairman Sir Patrick McLoughlin from his Labour counterpart Ian Lavery and Cat Smith, shadow minister for voter engagement. \"Parties and politicians have a responsibility to set an example, by treating others with dignity and respect, including those with whom we strongly disagree,\" they wrote. \"The Conservative Party has instead promoted personal attacks as a core component of its national campaign. \"Abuse against candidates on social media is completely unacceptable. The Conservative Party perpetrated this on an industrial scale by spending millions of pounds to post highly personalised and nasty attack adverts on voters' Facebook timelines without their permission.\" They claimed Labour \"fought a positive, hopeful campaign\" and insisted that all its MPs ran campaigns based on its policies rather than personal attacks. On Monday, Mrs May - asked whether Mr Corbyn was doing enough in response to complaints of intimidation - said she was \"surprised at any party leader who's not willing to condemn that\". Conservative Simon Hart has secured Wednesday afternoon's Westminster Hall debate on \"the abuse and intimidation of candidates and the public in UK elections\". Speaking on the BBC's Daily Politics on Tuesday, Mr Hart said there had been a clear change in attitudes towards MPs and campaigners between the 2015 and 2017 general elections. People wanting to publicly support candidates were being \"driven away from politics at a time when we need them\" he said. \"This extends way beyond the so-called bullying of MPs, this is about online bullying generally,\" he said, claiming there had been a \"deafening silence\" from political leaders. Mr Hart claimed the emergence of Jeremy Corbyn-backing grassroots organisation Momentum had played a \"significant part\" in this shift. But Momentum dismissed his accusation as \"baseless\". \"If we are going to tackle the abuse MPs from across the political spectrum face, Simon Hart and other Conservative MPs should stop making baseless accusations for which they offer no proof, and instead think about how we can work together to find a solution,\" a spokesman for the group said.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nLabour has accused the Conservatives of running a \"negative, nasty campaign\" targeting shadow home secretary Diane Abbott in particular.  \n\nArticle:  The Conservative Party has instead promoted personal attacks as a core component of its national campaign.

The Royal party are due back in the UK on Friday evening, after a five-day tour that began in Poland on Monday. On the last day of the tour, the Duchess, who comes from a musical family and played the flute at school, took the musicians through the first notes of Beethoven's fifth symphony. The royal couple then listened to a performance of a symphony especially adapted for young people, and then went on stage to learn more about the orchestra. Earlier, Catherine and William walked around the stage accompanying six children trying out different instruments, including a violin, flute, timpani [kettle drums] and trombone. Later the Duke of Cambridge gave Prince George and Princess Charlotte a guided tour of a helicopter at the Airbus factory in Hamburg. Prince George tried on a pilot's helmet while Princess Charlotte played with buttons in the cockpit. The Duke flew helicopters when he was an air ambulance pilot. Antoine van Gent, head of flight testing at Airbus, said: \"The Duke was very relaxed showing his children the professional aircraft he uses. \"George was excited, with the first helicopter he wanted to sit in the cockpit and then he wanted to sit in the next one, he already knew there was a difference between them.\" Charlotte was less impressed after taking a tumble on the concrete after leaving the aircraft but Mr van Gent said she enjoyed playing in the pilot's seat.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge visited a music school and a helicopter factory in Germany on Wednesday.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "The", "▁Duke", "▁and", "▁Duch", "ess", "▁of", "▁Cambridge", "▁visited", "▁a", "▁music", "▁school", "▁and", "▁a", "▁hel", "ic", "opter", "▁factory", "▁in", "▁Germany", "▁on", "▁Wed", "nes", "day", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁The", "▁Duch", "ess", "▁of", "▁Cambridge", "▁has", "▁visited", "▁a", "▁school", "▁in", "▁Hamburg", "▁where", "▁she", "▁met", "▁pup", "ils", "▁and", "▁teachers", "▁and", "▁learned", "▁about", "▁the", "▁city", "'", "s", "▁education", "▁system", ".", "▁The", "▁Duch", "ess"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.13875322043895721, -0.006735478527843952, -0.0008386432309634984, 0.0, 0.0, -1.3947389561508317e-05, 0.0, -0.12244146317243576, -0.03630531579256058, -0.7274789810180664, -0.0008199428557418287, -0.03512318432331085, -0.3694020211696625, -0.05277330055832863, 0.0, 0.0, -1.4662635294371285e-05, -0.04782303422689438, -0.07891827821731567, -0.3662515878677368, -0.030658135190606117, 0.0, 0.0, -0.013286740519106388, -0.0008914072532206774, 0.0, -0.0019351581577211618, 0.0, 0.0, -1.9073468138230965e-06, 0.0, 0.0, -0.026521854102611542, -0.558016300201416, 0.0, -6.568216485902667e-05, -0.0019584777764976025, -0.7347052693367004, -0.32991066575050354, -0.0009104635682888329, -0.6253618597984314, -0.11754108965396881, -0.5261191129684448, -0.5317023992538452, -0.07233822345733643, -0.6202106475830078, -0.5891109704971313, 0.0, -0.006339321844279766, -0.5172489881515503, -0.1749730259180069, -0.6452552676200867, -0.002565547125414014, -0.0024141711182892323, -0.3789534866809845, 0.0, 0.0, -0.0639328807592392, -9.30981186684221e-05, -0.00040737437666393816, -0.18019482493400574, -0.008787532337009907, 0.0], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "The": -0.13875322043895721, "▁Duke": -0.006735478527843952, "▁and": -0.1749730259180069, "▁Duch": -0.008787532337009907, "ess": 0.0, "▁of": -6.568216485902667e-05, "▁Cambridge": -0.0019584777764976025, "▁visited": -0.32991066575050354, "▁a": -0.0009104635682888329, "▁music": -0.7274789810180664, "▁school": -0.6253618597984314, "▁hel": -0.05277330055832863, "ic": 0.0, "opter": 0.0, "▁factory": -1.4662635294371285e-05, "▁in": -0.11754108965396881, "▁Germany": -0.07891827821731567, "▁on": -0.3662515878677368, "▁Wed": -0.030658135190606117, "nes": 0.0, "day": 0.0, ".": -0.00040737437666393816, "##": -0.0019351581577211618, "#": 0.0, "Art": -1.9073468138230965e-06, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "▁The": -0.18019482493400574, "▁has": -0.7347052693367004, "▁Hamburg": -0.5261191129684448, "▁where": -0.5317023992538452, "▁she": -0.07233822345733643, "▁met": -0.6202106475830078, "▁pup": -0.5891109704971313, "ils": 0.0, "▁teachers": -0.5172489881515503, "▁learned": -0.6452552676200867, "▁about": -0.002565547125414014, "▁the": -0.0024141711182892323, "▁city": -0.3789534866809845, "'": 0.0, "s": 0.0, "▁education": -0.0639328807592392, "▁system": -9.30981186684221e-05}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

Non-compliance with the pricing guidelines may have led to the termination of contracts, it found. Apple has not yet responded to a request for comment. At the time of the investigation, Apple denied that it controlled its products' pricing, telling Reuters that resellers \"set their own prices for the Apple products they sell in Russia and around the world\". The regulator said Apple had now ended its price-fixing practices but has not said whether the company faces a fine. The FAS claimed that Apple Rus monitored the retail prices for the iPhone 5c, 5s, 6, 6 Plus, 6s and 6s Plus. \"In the case of the establishment of 'inappropriate' prices, the Russian subsidiary of Apple sent emails to resellers asking them to change,\" the watchdog said. The deputy head of the FAS, Andrey Tsarikovsky, added that \"Apple actively co-operated\" with the investigation and that the company had \"adopted the necessary measures to eliminate violations of the law\". That included training employees in the \"anti-monopoly legislation norms\" in Russia. In May, the FAS found that Google used its dominant position to force its own apps and services on users and fined it Â£5m ($6m). And, in November, the regulator opened an investigation into whether Microsoft abused its position in the security market with Windows 10, following a complaint from Moscow-based anti-virus firm Kaspersky.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nRussia's anti-monopoly watchdog has fined Apple for allegedly forcing its retailers to maintain the recommended prices of its phones.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "Russ", "ia", "'", "s", "▁anti", "-", "mon", "opol", "y", "▁watch", "dog", "▁has", "▁f", "ined", "▁Apple", "▁for", "▁alleg", "edly", "▁forcing", "▁its", "▁ret", "ail", "ers", "▁to", "▁maintain", "▁the", "▁recommended", "▁prices", "▁of", "▁its", "▁ph", "ones", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁The", "▁US", "▁military", "▁has", "▁been", "▁ordered", "▁to", "▁stop", "▁using", "▁a", "▁controvers", "ial", "▁fa", "cial", "▁recognition", "▁technology", "▁that", "▁can", "▁identify", "▁people", "▁in", "▁crow"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.03816259279847145, -0.035052284598350525, -0.006764251738786697, 0.0, -0.08219423145055771, 0.0, -5.602820692729438e-06, 0.0, 0.0, -0.030790500342845917, 0.0, -0.139367938041687, -0.02622392401099205, 0.0, -2.622600959512056e-06, -0.7647213935852051, -0.6985873579978943, -0.0005529781919904053, -0.0290612131357193, -0.4349021315574646, -0.029405411332845688, 0.0, -0.07888996601104736, -0.0012718691723421216, -0.36596888303756714, -0.19031523168087006, -0.0002885640424210578, -0.004540253430604935, -0.001932302606292069, -0.3881930112838745, -0.37025249004364014, 0.0, -0.11816835403442383, -0.00450572045519948, 0.0, -0.0002420847595203668, 0.0, 0.0, -5.960462772236497e-07, 0.0, 0.0, -0.052207283675670624, -0.6751760840415955, -0.421933114528656, -0.253635972738266, -0.6385834813117981, -0.20021255314350128, -0.00034481301554478705, -0.23736479878425598, -0.004909484181553125, -0.6572777032852173, -0.8130313754081726, 0.0, -0.320180743932724, 0.0, -0.00024029705673456192, -0.9462548494338989, -0.15745171904563904, -0.8815265893936157, -0.01768288016319275, -0.006996891926974058, -0.1359768658876419, -0.2597641050815582], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "Russ": -0.03816259279847145, "ia": -0.035052284598350525, "'": -0.006764251738786697, "s": 0.0, "▁anti": -0.08219423145055771, "-": 0.0, "mon": -5.602820692729438e-06, "opol": 0.0, "y": 0.0, "▁watch": -0.030790500342845917, "dog": 0.0, "▁has": -0.253635972738266, "▁f": -0.02622392401099205, "ined": 0.0, "▁Apple": -2.622600959512056e-06, "▁for": -0.7647213935852051, "▁alleg": -0.6985873579978943, "edly": -0.0005529781919904053, "▁forcing": -0.0290612131357193, "▁its": -0.3881930112838745, "▁ret": -0.029405411332845688, "ail": 0.0, "ers": -0.07888996601104736, "▁to": -0.00034481301554478705, "▁maintain": -0.36596888303756714, "▁the": -0.19031523168087006, "▁recommended": -0.0002885640424210578, "▁prices": -0.004540253430604935, "▁of": -0.001932302606292069, "▁ph": -0.37025249004364014, "ones": 0.0, ".": -0.11816835403442383, "##": -0.0002420847595203668, "#": 0.0, "Art": -5.960462772236497e-07, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "▁The": -0.052207283675670624, "▁US": -0.6751760840415955, "▁military": -0.421933114528656, "▁been": -0.6385834813117981, "▁ordered": -0.20021255314350128, "▁stop": -0.23736479878425598, "▁using": -0.004909484181553125, "▁a": -0.6572777032852173, "▁controvers": -0.8130313754081726, "ial": 0.0, "▁fa": -0.320180743932724, "cial": 0.0, "▁recognition": -0.00024029705673456192, "▁technology": -0.9462548494338989, "▁that": -0.15745171904563904, "▁can": -0.8815265893936157, "▁identify": -0.01768288016319275, "▁people": -0.006996891926974058, "▁in": -0.1359768658876419, "▁crow": -0.2597641050815582}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

It was eventually handed to Donald Mackechnie, 66, at his home in Glasgow. The Bible had originally belonged to the great-grandfather of Mr Mackechnie's grandmother. Mr Whitehead, who was gifted the pocket-sized book in 2001 by an amateur Bible collector from Cleveland, Ohio, had rediscovered it when moving home in May. Noting that the Bible bore the name Alexander MacDonald of Inverness with the date 1 January, 1866, he decided to track down the descendants of Mr MacDonald, who was born in 1825 and worked as a ship master, wine merchant and grocer. After contacting Highland Council, he was put in touch with Anne Fraser, a historian at the Highland Archive Centre who created a MacDonald family tree. Mr Whitehead then used social media to track down Mr Mackechnie's daughter Mairi in Glasgow, who alerted her Islay-raised father. The Bible, which had a four-leaf clover tucked within its pages, was hand-delivered to Mr Mackechnie by Alistair Begg, a pastor at Mr Whitehead's church in Ohio who is originally from Glasgow and was visiting relatives in the city last month. Mr Mackechnie, clerk to the board at St Columba Gaelic Church of Scotland in Glasgow, said: \"There was a knock on the door one day and this chap was standing there. \"I almost fell on the floor when he explained what he was giving me. I could not believe it, it was such a shock and a surprise. \"The whole family are delighted and over the moon to receive his previously unheard of family heirloom. \"It does not even enter your head that this kind of thing could ever happen - it is quite amazing.\" Mr Mackechnie, a retired mechanical design draftsman, said the story of the Bible's return to Scotland is \"fascinating and shows there are still kind people in the world\". Mr Whitehead, who chose the book from a collection of more than 100, said he believes it is not a coincidence that it has been returned to the family of the original owner. \"I am very pleased that this keepsake treasure of the MacDonald family, located in Cleveland, Ohio, was safely returned to Mr MacDonald's native homeland,\" he said. \"It would not have happened if it had not been for the tireless effort of Anne Fraser and the kind gracious act of my senior pastor, Alistair Begg.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nAn American man has tracked down the family of a Bible that originally belonged to a Scottish ancestor of his and returned it to them.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "An", "▁American", "▁man", "▁has", "▁track", "ed", "▁down", "▁the", "▁family", "▁of", "▁a", "▁Bible", "▁that", "▁originally", "▁belonged", "▁to", "▁a", "▁Scottish", "▁ancest", "or", "▁of", "▁his", "▁and", "▁returned", "▁it", "▁to", "▁them", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁The", "▁", "2", "0", "1", "8", "▁FIFA", "▁World", "▁Cup", "▁will", "▁be", "▁the", "▁", "2", "1", "st", "▁FIFA", "▁World", "▁Cup", ",", "▁the", "▁quad", "ren", "n", "ial", "▁international", "▁men"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.506456732749939, -6.890059739816934e-05, -0.2287837564945221, -0.04530894383788109, -0.11778727173805237, 0.0, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -0.002928851405158639, -0.05318766087293625, -7.152555099310121e-07, -0.01593826338648796, -0.0015092422254383564, -0.3623887300491333, -0.4215236306190491, 0.0, 0.0, -0.1385193020105362, -0.40138334035873413, -0.13180135190486908, 0.0, -0.5906848907470703, -3.0517112463712692e-05, -0.7178388237953186, -0.017040153965353966, -0.0019286142196506262, -1.597391747054644e-05, -0.017714735120534897, -0.12526115775108337, -0.00036614391137845814, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -0.00037043384509161115, 0.0, 0.0, -1.1920928244535389e-07, 0.0, 0.0, -0.06442133337259293, -0.25245243310928345, -0.7341488003730774, -0.10334193706512451, -0.025298919528722763, -0.2853751480579376, -0.36009740829467773, 0.0, 0.0, -0.9728283882141113, -9.214453893946484e-05, -3.576278118089249e-07, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -2.3841855067985307e-07, -0.0005828827270306647, 0.0, 0.0, -2.3841855067985307e-07, -0.0013228246243670583, -0.006715940777212381, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.00012933371181134135, 0.0], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "An": -0.506456732749939, "▁American": -6.890059739816934e-05, "▁man": -0.2287837564945221, "▁has": -0.04530894383788109, "▁track": -0.11778727173805237, "ed": 0.0, "▁down": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "▁the": -0.0013228246243670583, "▁family": -0.05318766087293625, "▁of": -0.5906848907470703, "▁a": -0.1385193020105362, "▁Bible": -0.0015092422254383564, "▁that": -0.3623887300491333, "▁originally": -0.4215236306190491, "▁belonged": 0.0, "▁to": -1.597391747054644e-05, "▁Scottish": -0.40138334035873413, "▁ancest": -0.13180135190486908, "or": 0.0, "▁his": -3.0517112463712692e-05, "▁and": -0.7178388237953186, "▁returned": -0.017040153965353966, "▁it": -0.0019286142196506262, "▁them": -0.017714735120534897, ".": -0.12526115775108337, "##": -0.00037043384509161115, "#": 0.0, "Art": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "▁The": -0.06442133337259293, "▁": 0.0, "2": 0.0, "0": -0.10334193706512451, "1": 0.0, "8": -0.2853751480579376, "▁FIFA": -0.0005828827270306647, "▁World": 0.0, "▁Cup": 0.0, "▁will": -0.9728283882141113, "▁be": -9.214453893946484e-05, "st": -2.3841855067985307e-07, ",": -2.3841855067985307e-07, "▁quad": -0.006715940777212381, "ren": 0.0, "n": 0.0, "ial": 0.0, "▁international": -0.00012933371181134135, "▁men": 0.0}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

She had last been seen alive at 08:00 that day. Mrs Logie had sustained head injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene by the Scottish Ambulance Service. Her family paid tribute to the \"beloved mother, grandmother and friend\". They said Mrs Logie would be sadly missed, adding that she was \"born, bred and lived in the Leven area all her life\". \"The family are assisting the police in the investigation and wish to be left alone at this difficult time,\" they added. Detectives said there were no signs of a break in and so far no clear motive but they said Mrs Logie was murdered in \"a brutal\" way. Mrs Logie was said to be independent, capable and was an active member of the local church. She had spent the festive period with one of her sons in England, returning home in the new year. Police said Mrs Logie's neighbour had spoken to her in the morning. She told the neighbour she was going to the shops and then to the hospital to visit a friend. When the neighbour did not hear from Mrs Logie again he went to investigate and found her dead in her home. Det Ch Insp Keith Hardie, of Police Scotland, said: \"She had a brutal head injury. \"An 82-year-old woman in the safety of her own home being subjected to such a brutal attack is horrendous.\" \"Whoever has been responsible for causing Mary's death has preyed on a vulnerable and elderly member of the community and we are pursuing various lines of inquiry as part of this ongoing investigation. \"I would ask that anyone who remembers seeing anything suspicious in the Green Gates area in the days and hours before Mary was found contacts police immediately. \"In addition, anyone with any other information that can help us find Mary's killer should also get in touch.\" Mrs Logan's local Church of Scotland minister said the whole community had been \"shocked\" and \"stunned\" by the murder. The Rev Gilbert Nisbet, of Leven Parish Church, said: \"Mary was part of the church community and very much involved in the life of the church. \"I have been the minister here for nine years and she came virtually every Sunday and I would chat to her at the door. \"Mary was friendly and outgoing, a kind lady who was bright and interesting to talk to.

She said that Sophia was wearing just a nappy and T-shirt when she wandered off. \"The only thing I was thinking was well, hopefully the dog would have kept her warm,\" Ms Cook was quoted as saying. \"If [the dog] wasn't with her, I don't know whether they would have found her.\" The family issued a statement thanking emergency services and promising that Poppy would be \"well fed this evening\".\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\nA pet dog is being credited with keeping a little girl safe after the pair wandered away from their family home and could not be found for hours.\n\n###\nArticle: Steven Maclean bundled home the opener five minutes before half-time. The hosts, slacker after the break, had beleaguered striker Larnell Cole sent-off after he confronted the referee. Liam Craig sealed the win from the penalty spot with two minutes to play, before Graham Cummins finished a sumptuous stoppage-time move. And things got worse still for Caley Thistle after the match, with captain Gary Warren shown a red card in the tunnel. Saints remain five points clear of Hearts in fourth place, and closed the gap on third-placed Rangers, who play Aberdeen on Sunday, to three points. With game after game ticking past, Inverness' position looks increasingly perilous. Next weekend's trip to Motherwell, second-bottom on goal difference, is now seismic. This contest turned nightmarish for the hosts after a bright opening, but the truth is, given their predicament, Caley Thistle did not threaten St Johnstone's goal enough. Billy Mckay sent a shot over from close range. Alex Fisher nodded a diving header wide. Carl Tremarco miscued a volley. Greg Tansey did draw a save from Alan Mannus when he rasped in an effort from outside the box, but Richie Foran's side never looked likely to find the net. Their best opportunity came immediately after the Saints went ahead, when Tansey fed Cole, who seemed to panic in a terrific position and shot straight at Mannus. Cole's dismissal ended the contest when he appeared to be cautioned twice for challenging referee Stephen Finnie's decision not to award a foul. St Johnstone were merciless and could have had more. With just one win from their last 21 league games, Inverness look deep in trouble. Tommy Wright's side deserve so much credit. Saints were tactically brilliant, so strong defensively and ruthlessly capitalised on their man advantage. They took one of their few first-half chances when Michael Coulson broke down the left and sent a dangerous ball across the six-yard box. Owain Fon Williams could only parry into the danger area, Cummins' shot was blocked but Maclean followed up to force it home. They should have had another when Craig's superb curling corner flew all the way to the back post where Cummins slid in and somehow knocked it over from two yards. Craig, in his 300th appearance for the club, coolly converted a spot-kick after Cummins was tripped to seal the points. Cummins then slammed home after Miller danced around the area to tee him up, before Craig cracked the bar amid the late flurry. With a tendency to finish the season strongly, and just a three-point gap to Rangers, the Perth side look capable of something special this term. Inverness CT manager Richie Foran: \"It is a tough time of the season to be sitting bottom, and I need real men to stand up to that, but not enough of them did that today. \"It is pure luck we are still in it and it is only four points. I sound like a broken record but one win changes it - that is the truth.

A separate IS attack on the north-eastern city of Hassakeh has displaced 60,000 people, the UN says. Kobane became a symbol of Kurdish resistance in January after an IS siege lasting several months was repelled. IS launched an apparent two-pronged offensive on Thursday after Kurdish fighters from the Popular Protection Units (YPG) cut off one of the militants' major supply routes near Raqqa. Raqqa is the de facto capital of the IS \"caliphate\", whose creation IS announced a year ago after it captured large swathes of northern and western Iraq and parts of Syria. \"According to medical sources and Kobane residents, 120 civilians were executed by IS in their homes or killed by the group's rockets or snipers,\" said Rami Abdel Rahman, who heads the UK-based Observatory. He said women and children were among the bodies found inside houses and on the streets of the town, which is close to the border with Turkey. He described it as one of the biggest massacres by the group in the country since its offensive began last summer. The militants took the town by surprise when they launched their attack on Thursday, five months after IS was removed by Kurdish fighters backed by US-led coalition strikes. The attack at dawn on Thursday began when militants detonated a car bomb, followed by two more bombings. Reports said some of the militants may have hidden themselves among returning refugees and disguised themselves by wearing Kurdish militia uniforms. In a nearby village, IS reportedly shot dead at least 20 civilians, including women and children. Activists say clashes between some IS militants and the Kurdish YPG forces are continuing in the town. Separately on Friday, the UN said an estimated 50,000 people had been displaced within the city of Hassakeh after another IS offensive there. Another 10,000 have fled northwards towards a town near the Turkish border, it added. Hassakeh, about 270km (180 miles) east of Kobane, has been under the control of both government forces and Kurdish fighters, and IS militants have been trying to capture it for months. Overall, in four years of armed conflict in Syria, more than 200,000 people have lost their lives and more than 11 million others have been forced from their homes.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nIS fighters have reportedly killed more than 120 civilians in the town of Kobane, in northern Syria.  \n\n[INST] Write a title for this article: Azerbaijan, Turkey, Iran and Pakistan have signed a memorandum of understanding on c", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "IS", "▁f", "igh", "ters", "▁have", "▁reported", "ly", "▁killed", "▁more", "▁than", "▁", "1", "2", "0", "▁civ", "ili", "ans", "▁in", "▁the", "▁town", "▁of", "▁Kob", "ane", ",", "▁in", "▁northern", "▁Sy", "ria", ".", "▁▁", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "[", "INST", "]", "▁Write", "▁a", "▁title", "▁for", "▁this", "▁article", ":", "▁A", "zer", "ba", "ij", "an", ",", "▁Turkey", ",", "▁Iran", "▁and", "▁Pakistan", "▁have", "▁signed", "▁a", "▁memor", "and", "um", "▁of", "▁understanding", "▁on", "▁co"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.3548179864883423, -0.3081248104572296, 0.0, 0.0, -0.6879099011421204, -0.28553733229637146, 0.0, -0.0809343233704567, -0.44501984119415283, 0.0, -5.602820692729438e-06, -0.015395139344036579, -0.1732504814863205, 0.0, -0.03505389392375946, 0.0, 0.0, -0.00013016807497479022, -0.05556759238243103, -0.16893137991428375, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.6933013200759888, -0.5443602800369263, -0.04676105082035065, 0.0, 0.0, -0.1310860812664032, -0.2070462703704834, 0.0, 0.0, -0.0799158588051796, 0.0, 0.0, -0.5766573548316956, -0.015710510313510895, -0.0012916326522827148, -4.768370445162873e-07, -2.992108420585282e-05, -2.0265558760002023e-06, 0.0, -0.8794340491294861, -1.1394256353378296, 0.0, 0.0, -0.0008386432309634984, -0.5476482510566711, -1.2341352701187134, -0.8832157850265503, -0.2025294303894043, -0.2789325714111328, -0.1756661981344223, -0.267645001411438, -0.18356646597385406, -0.17302820086479187, -0.11254116892814636, 0.0, 0.0, -0.11849506944417953, -8.583032467868179e-06, -0.491107702255249, -0.5607796907424927], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "IS": -0.3548179864883423, "▁f": -0.3081248104572296, "igh": 0.0, "ters": 0.0, "▁have": -0.267645001411438, "▁reported": -0.28553733229637146, "ly": 0.0, "▁killed": -0.0809343233704567, "▁more": -0.44501984119415283, "▁than": 0.0, "▁": -5.602820692729438e-06, "1": -0.015395139344036579, "2": -0.1732504814863205, "0": 0.0, "▁civ": -0.03505389392375946, "ili": 0.0, "ans": 0.0, "▁in": -0.5443602800369263, "▁the": -0.05556759238243103, "▁town": -0.16893137991428375, "▁of": -0.11849506944417953, "▁Kob": 0.0, "ane": 0.0, ",": -0.8832157850265503, "▁northern": -0.04676105082035065, "▁Sy": 0.0, "ria": 0.0, ".": -0.1310860812664032, "▁▁": -0.2070462703704834, "[": -0.0799158588051796, "INST": 0.0, "]": 0.0, "▁Write": -0.5766573548316956, "▁a": -0.17302820086479187, "▁title": -0.0012916326522827148, "▁for": -4.768370445162873e-07, "▁this": -2.992108420585282e-05, "▁article": -2.0265558760002023e-06, ":": 0.0, "▁A": -0.8794340491294861, "zer": -1.1394256353378296, "ba": 0.0, "ij": 0.0, "an": -0.0008386432309634984, "▁Turkey": -1.2341352701187134, "▁Iran": -0.2025294303894043, "▁and": -0.2789325714111328, "▁Pakistan": -0.1756661981344223, "▁signed": -0.18356646597385406, "▁memor": -0.11254116892814636, "and": 0.0, "um": 0.0, "▁understanding": -8.583032467868179e-06, "▁on": -0.491107702255249, "▁co": -0.5607796907424927}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

But many are put off - because a licence can cost ??1,000 - despite facing a fine of up to ??20,000, Southampton City Council said. The authority estimated a total of 1,500 unlicensed HMOs in the area. Shelter helpline adviser Nadeem Khan said fear of eviction and living in poorly maintained properties are frequent concerns raised by HMO tenants. \"Because of the huge shortage of affordable homes people are being forced into rented homes which are unregulated.

Since the days of Jesus and his 12 male apostles the Church has had exclusively male leaders - bishops whose authority has been handed down the generations by the laying on of hands. Hilary Cotton chairs Women and the Church, which campaigns for women bishops. \"Saying yes to women bishops is a cosmic shift,\" she says. \"It changes our whole understanding of what God intended people to be, and even changes the Church's theology by recognising that men and women are equally chosen to lead it.\" A senior figure on the \"high church\" wing of the Anglicanism, Prebendary David Houlding, says creating women bishops represents \"a massive shift\" in the way the Church presented itself to the world. \"It's an unprecedented acceptance by the Church of the secular values of society\", he says. \"There was a lot of damage to the Church's reputation when the measure was defeated before. It's terrified of sending the wrong signal again.\" Samuel Margrave, who also opposes the legislation, told the Synod: \"This is a show for the media. It's the end of the Church as we know it.\" The Reverend Lindsay Southern, the Vicar of Catterick in North Yorkshire, who supports the proposals, said a single vote for woman bishops would have huge long-term effects. \"It might look like a small change in direction from the outside, but it's like a ship at sea - a change in course over time will lead us to a completely different place.\" Women now constitute a third of the 11,000 Anglican priests, several of whom have reached senior positions. The Church's 42 dioceses have given unanimous backing to the latest proposals. But to take such a profound step, each of the Synod's three houses - representing bishops, clergy and lay people - needed to support legislation to create women bishops by a majority of two-thirds. The legislation failed in November 2012 because lay synod members who supported women bishops nevertheless believed that traditionalists were not getting sufficient exemptions from serving under them. The latest proposals would allow traditionalist parishes to ask a woman bishop for a male alternative, and take any dispute over the process to an independent ombudsman. \"There will be an 'expectation' that bishops will do their best to accommodate (traditionalist) parishes,\" says Prebendary Rod Thomas, the leader of the conservative evangelical group, Reform. \"But in the end it depends on trust, and that is the big question. Will there be trust?\" Evangelical traditionalists oppose women bishops because of their belief that the Bible calls for men to head churches. Traditionalists on the Catholic, or High Church, wing of Anglicanism believe that because Jesus chose only men to make up his 12 apostles, only men should lead the Church. In fact some do not believe that women can be priests, so that were a woman bishop to ordain a man as a priest, he\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nThe Church of England voted to allow women to be bishops, ending a tradition of exclusively male leadership that has lasted for 2,000 years.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "The", "▁Church", "▁of", "▁England", "▁voted", "▁to", "▁allow", "▁women", "▁to", "▁be", "▁b", "ish", "ops", ",", "▁ending", "▁a", "▁tradition", "▁of", "▁exclus", "ively", "▁male", "▁leadership", "▁that", "▁has", "▁last", "ed", "▁for", "▁", "2", ",", "0", "0", "0", "▁years", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁The", "▁Church", "▁of", "▁England", "▁voted", "▁to", "▁allow", "▁women", "▁to", "▁be", "▁b", "ish", "ops", ",", "▁ending", "▁a", "▁tradition", "▁of", "▁exclus", "ively"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.0025328481569886208, -0.000683074293192476, 0.0, 0.0, -0.3906400799751282, -0.016289588063955307, -3.6954811548639555e-06, -1.0728830375228426e-06, -0.00015853578224778175, -0.02327316626906395, -1.1920928244535389e-07, 0.0, 0.0, -0.05601201578974724, -0.5561040043830872, -2.7417760065873154e-05, -0.10481968522071838, -0.45589178800582886, -0.6994364261627197, 0.0, -2.3841855067985307e-07, -0.2526514530181885, -0.01765734702348709, -0.7267545461654663, -0.06433526426553726, 0.0, -0.2532897889614105, -0.011671590618789196, 0.0, -0.00024029705673456192, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.0008454324561171234, -0.003916214685887098, 0.0, -3.0397906812140718e-05, 0.0, 0.0, -1.9073468138230965e-06, 0.0, 0.0, -0.028171280398964882, -0.24572394788265228, 0.0, 0.0, -0.37119734287261963, -0.021125074476003647, -2.3841855067985307e-07, 0.0, -4.768370445162873e-07, -5.602820692729438e-06, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.006732044741511345, -1.1920928244535389e-07, 0.0, -1.6689286894688848e-06, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "The": -0.0025328481569886208, "▁Church": -0.24572394788265228, "▁of": 0.0, "▁England": 0.0, "▁voted": -0.37119734287261963, "▁to": -4.768370445162873e-07, "▁allow": -2.3841855067985307e-07, "▁women": 0.0, "▁be": -5.602820692729438e-06, "▁b": 0.0, "ish": 0.0, "ops": 0.0, ",": -0.006732044741511345, "▁ending": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "▁a": 0.0, "▁tradition": -1.6689286894688848e-06, "▁exclus": 0.0, "ively": 0.0, "▁male": -2.3841855067985307e-07, "▁leadership": -0.2526514530181885, "▁that": -0.01765734702348709, "▁has": -0.7267545461654663, "▁last": -0.06433526426553726, "ed": 0.0, "▁for": -0.2532897889614105, "▁": -0.011671590618789196, "2": 0.0, "0": 0.0, "▁years": 0.0, ".": -0.0008454324561171234, "##": -3.0397906812140718e-05, "#": 0.0, "Art": -1.9073468138230965e-06, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "▁The": -0.028171280398964882}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

The dog, a one-year-old Australian sheepdog named Poppy, went with her. Police confirmed that Poppy's barking alerted rescuers to the whereabouts of the pair after a seven-hour search. Rescuers found Sophia and Poppy 200m from a dam on the family's property. The Australian Broadcasting Corp. quoted Sophia's grandmother, Vera Cook, who credited the dog with saving the toddler's life. She said that Sophia was wearing just a nappy and T-shirt when she wandered off. \"The only thing I was thinking was well, hopefully the dog would have kept her warm,\" Ms Cook was quoted as saying. \"If [the dog] wasn't with her, I don't know whether they would have found her.\" The family issued a statement thanking emergency services and promising that Poppy would be \"well fed this evening\".\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\nA pet dog is being credited with keeping a little girl safe after the pair wandered away from their family home and could not be found for hours.\n\n###\nArticle: The Gobbins is a dramatic cliff face walk in Islandmagee, County Antrim. The pathway had been damaged by storms and record rainfall, according to Mid and East Antrim Borough Council. Its bridge structures have not been damaged and the council plans to restore access and reopen the coastal pathway \"as soon as possible\". However, no date has yet been set for when the public can expect to use the path again. \"Mid and East Antrim Borough Council wishes to ensure that all experiences at The Gobbins are safe and enjoyable and the health and safety of our visitors is of paramount importance,\" a council spokesperson said. \"We are working to have the path reopened as soon as possible and apologise for any inconvenience caused.\" The Gobbins Visitor Centre and exhibition remains open to the public while the repairs are being carried out. The original Edwardian structure first opened in 1902 but fell into disrepair and closed to the public in the 1950s. In August last year, it was unveiled as the council's newest tourist attraction. The path is carved into black basalt cliffs and is connected by a network of walkways and bridges, including a new tubular bridge which is an almost identical replica of the original Edwardian structure.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nThe Gobbins is a dramatic cliff face walk in Islandmagee, County Antrim.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "The", "▁G", "obb", "ins", "▁is", "▁a", "▁dram", "atic", "▁cl", "iff", "▁face", "▁walk", "▁in", "▁Island", "m", "age", "e", ",", "▁County", "▁An", "trim", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁The", "▁US", "▁Federal", "▁Reserve", "▁has", "▁raised", "▁its", "▁key", "▁interest", "▁rate", "▁by", "▁a", "▁quarter", "▁of", "▁a", "▁percentage", "▁point", "▁to", "▁a", "▁range", "▁of", "▁", "1", ".", "7", "5", "%", "▁to", "▁", "2", "%.", "▁It", "▁is"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.36809203028678894, -2.276871418871451e-05, 0.0, 0.0, -0.20810265839099884, -0.00010561384988250211, -0.02062995359301567, 0.0, -0.0005670370301231742, 0.0, -2.145764938177308e-06, -7.152555099310121e-07, -8.344646857949556e-07, -0.02378653734922409, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -3.814689989667386e-06, -4.541770613286644e-05, 0.0, 0.0, -0.38927438855171204, -0.38221779465675354, 0.0, -7.152555099310121e-07, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.09700565040111542, -0.5401892066001892, -0.5896337032318115, -0.0577055998146534, -0.2844756543636322, -0.09233541041612625, -0.254358172416687, -0.12156683206558228, -2.8132995794294402e-05, -0.0019286142196506262, -0.36256635189056396, -0.25199463963508606, 0.0, -0.20496362447738647, 0.0, -0.006717006675899029, 0.0, -0.27081429958343506, -0.00011538793478393927, -2.062299427052494e-05, -0.00024029705673456192, -2.062299427052494e-05, -0.11133772134780884, -0.0029246911872178316, -0.698254406452179, 0.0, -0.007372434716671705, -1.7881377516459906e-06, 0.0, 0.0, -0.2181946337223053, -0.1737237274646759, -0.14909081161022186], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "The": -0.36809203028678894, "▁G": -2.276871418871451e-05, "obb": 0.0, "ins": 0.0, "▁is": -0.14909081161022186, "▁a": -0.00011538793478393927, "▁dram": -0.02062995359301567, "atic": 0.0, "▁cl": -0.0005670370301231742, "iff": 0.0, "▁face": -2.145764938177308e-06, "▁walk": -7.152555099310121e-07, "▁in": -8.344646857949556e-07, "▁Island": -0.02378653734922409, "m": 0.0, "age": 0.0, "e": 0.0, ",": -3.814689989667386e-06, "▁County": -4.541770613286644e-05, "▁An": 0.0, "trim": 0.0, ".": -0.0029246911872178316, "##": -7.152555099310121e-07, "#": 0.0, "Art": 0.0, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "▁The": -0.09700565040111542, "▁US": -0.5401892066001892, "▁Federal": -0.5896337032318115, "▁Reserve": -0.0577055998146534, "▁has": -0.2844756543636322, "▁raised": -0.09233541041612625, "▁its": -0.254358172416687, "▁key": -0.12156683206558228, "▁interest": -2.8132995794294402e-05, "▁rate": -0.0019286142196506262, "▁by": -0.36256635189056396, "▁quarter": 0.0, "▁of": -0.00024029705673456192, "▁percentage": -0.006717006675899029, "▁point": 0.0, "▁to": -1.7881377516459906e-06, "▁range": -2.062299427052494e-05, "▁": 0.0, "1": -0.11133772134780884, "7": -0.698254406452179, "5": 0.0, "%": -0.007372434716671705, "2": 0.0, "%.": -0.2181946337223053, "▁It": -0.1737237274646759}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

Simpson shot 68 to set the target at one over and watched as 2010 champion McDowell missed a 25ft putt to force a play-off on the 18th. Lee Westwood took 73 for five over, while Tiger Woods (73) was seven over. Clubhouse scores in full Simpson, who climbs to fifth in the world, becomes the 15th different major winner in a row, the ninth straight first-time winner and the third consecutive American to win one of golf's grand slam events. \"I've never felt nerves like I felt today,\" said Simpson, who was pipped to the US money list title by England's Luke Donald last year. \"I had to hit my legs because I couldn't feel them. \"I probably prayed more the last three holes than I ever did in my life.\" Starting the final day four shots behind co-leaders McDowell and Jim Furyk, Simpson made his move with a spell of four birdies in five holes from the sixth. Parring his way home, he bettered the clubhouse mark of first-round leader Thompson, who shot 67, and took the outright lead when Furyk, who had been in front all day and led by two at one stage, bogeyed 16. Both 2003 champion Furyk and McDowell had a chance to force an 18-hole play-off on Monday, but the 42-year-old American finished with another bogey via the left bunker on 18 for a 74 to end two back and McDowell could only make par for a 73. \"It was grind and a slog, but I'll be back,\" said the 32-year-old McDowell, who had hoped to make it three Northern Irish wins in a row following Rory McIlroy's success last June. \"There's a mixture of emotions inside me right now, disappointment, deflation, pride but mostly just frustration.\" Furyk, whose hooked drive on the par-five 16th sparked his downfall, said: \"I don't know how to put that one into words, but I had my opportunities and my chances and it was right there. \"On that back nine, it was my tournament to win. I've only got myself to blame.\" Ireland's Padraig Harrington put up a serious challenge for a fourth major title and first since 2008 with a run of five birdies in 11 holes. But needing a birdie at the last to join Thompson, he ran up a bogey five after finding sand with his approach and ended with a 68 to finish three over. Americans David Toms (68), John Peterson (70) and Jason Dufner (70) also finished three over with 1994 and 1997 US Open winner Ernie Els on four over. The South African, who was third to McDowell at Pebble Beach, was one stroke off the lead after 15 but bogeyed the 16th and 18th for a 72. We shouldn't be too surprised at Simpson's victory. Twice a winner of big tournaments on the PGA Tour last year he is part of the wave of younger American players which shows that\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nSimpson won the US Open at Olympic Club in San Francisco, California, on Monday, beating Northern Ireland's Graeme McDowell and fellow American Michael Thompson by one shot .\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "Sim", "pson", "▁won", "▁the", "▁US", "▁Open", "▁at", "▁Olympic", "▁Club", "▁in", "▁San", "▁Francisco", ",", "▁California", ",", "▁on", "▁Monday", ",", "▁be", "ating", "▁Northern", "▁Ireland", "'", "s", "▁Gra", "eme", "▁Mc", "D", "ow", "ell", "▁and", "▁fellow", "▁American", "▁Michael", "▁Thompson", "▁by", "▁one", "▁shot", "▁.", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁The", "▁", "2", "6", "-", "year", "-", "old", "▁beat", "▁Northern", "▁Ireland", "'", "s", "▁Gra", "eme", "▁Mc"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.7462216019630432, 0.0, -0.5157285928726196, -0.00016115797916427255, -0.36111828684806824, 0.0, -1.025782823562622, -9.011816291604191e-05, 0.0, -0.0020692383404821157, -3.814689989667386e-06, 0.0, -0.13223770260810852, -0.5076833367347717, -0.20688188076019287, -0.42459431290626526, -0.01552237942814827, -0.3710530698299408, -0.12461370974779129, 0.0, -0.3617187440395355, -0.010168887674808502, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.0025900411419570446, -0.036290716379880905, 0.0, -2.992108420585282e-05, 0.0, -0.003559564705938101, -1.0251946150674485e-05, -0.00036459474358707666, -0.508243203163147, -0.1668786108493805, 0.0, -0.08125387132167816, 0.0, 0.0, -0.00010322991875000298, 0.0, 0.0, -0.052853360772132874, -0.013246743939816952, -0.018436027690768242, -0.08960866928100586, -0.3609568476676941, 0.0, -1.6689286894688848e-06, 0.0, -0.0008405489497818053, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "Sim": -0.7462216019630432, "pson": 0.0, "▁won": -0.5157285928726196, "▁the": -0.00016115797916427255, "▁US": -0.36111828684806824, "▁Open": 0.0, "▁at": -1.025782823562622, "▁Olympic": -9.011816291604191e-05, "▁Club": 0.0, "▁in": -0.0020692383404821157, "▁San": -3.814689989667386e-06, "▁Francisco": 0.0, ",": -0.3710530698299408, "▁California": -0.5076833367347717, "▁on": -0.42459431290626526, "▁Monday": -0.01552237942814827, "▁be": -0.12461370974779129, "ating": 0.0, "▁Northern": 0.0, "▁Ireland": 0.0, "'": 0.0, "s": 0.0, "▁Gra": 0.0, "eme": 0.0, "▁Mc": 0.0, "D": 0.0, "ow": 0.0, "ell": 0.0, "▁and": -0.0025900411419570446, "▁fellow": -0.036290716379880905, "▁American": 0.0, "▁Michael": -2.992108420585282e-05, "▁Thompson": 0.0, "▁by": -0.003559564705938101, "▁one": -1.0251946150674485e-05, "▁shot": -0.00036459474358707666, "▁.": -0.508243203163147, "##": -0.08125387132167816, "#": 0.0, "Art": -0.00010322991875000298, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "▁The": -0.052853360772132874, "▁": -0.013246743939816952, "2": -0.018436027690768242, "6": -0.08960866928100586, "-": -1.6689286894688848e-06, "year": 0.0, "old": 0.0, "▁beat": -0.0008405489497818053}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

Powers to change speed limits are to be handed to the Welsh Government, although it is not clear exactly when. But road safety charity Brake said the proposals were \"disappointing\" and suggested a change would lead to more deaths on the roads. In 2015, UK ministers suggested limits could be raised in some areas of England and Wales. Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies said: \"The M4 and A55 are vital arteries in the Welsh economy with thousands of commuters relying on their use every day. \"Welsh Conservatives believe that raising the speed limit from 70mph to 80mph [112km/h to 128km/h] could play a vital role in getting our economy moving and offering invaluable support to hard-pressed motorists, commuters and businesses. \"Consultation would be key - ensuring the views of all stakeholders are considered, so any change on the M4 and A55 is delivered with safety paramount.\" But Brake spokesman Jack Kushner said: \"We urge the government to reject needless proposals to increase speed limits to 80mph. We're disappointed it is being considered. \"Evidence from previous consultations made it clear that an increase would not only be dangerous - potentially 25 more deaths and 100 more serious injuries each year - but also highly damaging to the environment and economy.\" Political parties should focus instead on greater investment in \"sustainable\" travel and rural transport, he added.

Party transport spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said: \"A Plaid Cymru government will press ahead with improvements across the A55 and will resolve the M4 problem around Newport with an effective and cost-efficient scheme that can be delivered quickly.\" Welsh Labour said Conservative UK ministers had \"ditched plans to raise speed limits because of the huge safety risks\".

They were one of only two sides to earn a point at Ibrox in the league last season, and Duffy insists they will make it \"as uncomfortable as possible\". \"[A Morton win] would be a monumental upset,\" he told BBC Scotland. \"Rangers are a different proposition at Ibrox. Even though they drew last weekend [1-1 v Ross County], their home form has been very good over the last couple of years under Mark Warburton. \"The pitch, the expanse at Ibrox certainly suits the style they play. But we will certainly go there with a bit more heart after last night [the win at Raith]. \"The heavy pitch took its toll so we have to make sure we recover right and prepare tactically as well. \"We will go there and try to make it as uncomfortable a day as we possibly can for Rangers. If we play well, manage to stifle Rangers a little bit and keep the ball, we can frustrate them.\" With last season's Championship winners Rangers 27 points behind Celtic in the Premiership, Duffy believes Warburton's side will place extra emphasis on Sunday's fifth-round tie. \"The nature of being a big club like Rangers is the expectations are huge,\" noted the former Dundee centre-back and manager. \"They know it is their only chance of silverware this season. Celtic have already got the League Cup, and have all but wrapped up the league, so the only trophy available to Rangers and their supporters is the Scottish Cup. \"That will be the main objective and target now which will make it doubly difficult for us because all their focus will be on that. \"But we have got a job to do - to stay in the game and be difficult to beat. If Rangers get a little bit nervous, and their fans get frustrated, then you never know. But we have to be good enough to take advantage of those situations.\" Media playback is not supported on this device Morton's victory at Stark's Park lifted them to within two points of second-placed Dundee United and nine off Championship leaders Hibernian, but crucially, nine points clear of fifth-placed Queen of the South in the battle for a play-off place. Duffy believes a prospect of a tilt at the title is unrealistic, insisting a play-off spot will be a significant achievement for the Greenock outfit. \"If we get into the play-offs, we will be singing and dancing, there is no doubt about that,\" he added. \"But it is still a long way away. A lot of clubs will be challenging for that. There will be clubs that can find a run of form and you can have a dip. \"But the players showed terrific character to bounce back from a disappointing weekend [losing to Queen of the South] and it sets us up nicely for the Scottish Cup tie against Rangers.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nMorton manager Jim Duffy says his side will make it \"as uncomfortable as possible\" for Rangers in Sunday's Scottish Cup quarter-final tie at Ibrox.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "M", "orton", "▁manager", "▁Jim", "▁D", "uff", "y", "▁says", "▁his", "▁side", "▁will", "▁make", "▁it", "▁\"", "as", "▁un", "com", "fort", "able", "▁as", "▁possible", "\"", "▁for", "▁R", "angers", "▁in", "▁Sunday", "'", "s", "▁Scottish", "▁Cup", "▁quarter", "-", "final", "▁tie", "▁at", "▁I", "bro", "x", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁The", "▁UK", "▁government", "▁has", "▁launched", "▁a", "▁consult", "ation", "▁on", "▁a", "▁new", "▁law", "▁to", "▁protect", "▁children"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.013920949772000313, 0.0, -0.7084298729896545, -0.015863172709941864, -0.0019286142196506262, 0.0, 0.0, -0.24495947360992432, -0.0015918452991172671, -0.015432232990860939, -0.03235916048288345, -0.09227541089057922, -0.005165326874703169, -0.11828337609767914, -5.602820692729438e-06, -1.1920928244535389e-07, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.010168887674808502, 0.0, 0.0, -0.0030296400655061007, -3.182837463100441e-05, 0.0, -0.06273148208856583, -0.017292911186814308, 0.0, 0.0, -0.0003680505615193397, 0.0, -0.2087712287902832, -1.2278481335670222e-05, 0.0, -0.2973702847957611, -0.024590935558080673, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.5390046834945679, -0.010187885724008083, 0.0, -0.0029407371766865253, 0.0, 0.0, -5.483612312673358e-06, 0.0, 0.0, -0.0878557488322258, -0.5269027948379517, -0.0274268239736557, -0.08633224666118622, -1.0048274993896484, -0.003090488724410534, -0.07190088927745819, 0.0, -0.00735634146258235, -0.5260855555534363, -0.21911658346652985, -0.05515670403838158, -0.12137109786272049, -0.562885582447052, -0.6319574117660522], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "M": -0.013920949772000313, "orton": 0.0, "▁manager": -0.7084298729896545, "▁Jim": -0.015863172709941864, "▁D": -0.0019286142196506262, "uff": 0.0, "y": 0.0, "▁says": -0.24495947360992432, "▁his": -0.0015918452991172671, "▁side": -0.015432232990860939, "▁will": -0.03235916048288345, "▁make": -0.09227541089057922, "▁it": -0.005165326874703169, "▁\"": -0.11828337609767914, "as": -5.602820692729438e-06, "▁un": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "com": 0.0, "fort": 0.0, "able": 0.0, "▁as": -0.010168887674808502, "▁possible": 0.0, "\"": 0.0, "▁for": -0.0030296400655061007, "▁R": -3.182837463100441e-05, "angers": 0.0, "▁in": -0.06273148208856583, "▁Sunday": -0.017292911186814308, "'": 0.0, "s": 0.0, "▁Scottish": -0.0003680505615193397, "▁Cup": 0.0, "▁quarter": -0.2087712287902832, "-": -1.2278481335670222e-05, "final": 0.0, "▁tie": -0.2973702847957611, "▁at": -0.024590935558080673, "▁I": 0.0, "bro": 0.0, "x": 0.0, ".": -0.5390046834945679, "##": -0.0029407371766865253, "#": 0.0, "Art": -5.483612312673358e-06, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "▁The": -0.0878557488322258, "▁UK": -0.5269027948379517, "▁government": -0.0274268239736557, "▁has": -0.08633224666118622, "▁launched": -1.0048274993896484, "▁a": -0.5260855555534363, "▁consult": -0.07190088927745819, "ation": 0.0, "▁on": -0.00735634146258235, "▁new": -0.21911658346652985, "▁law": -0.05515670403838158, "▁to": -0.12137109786272049, "▁protect": -0.562885582447052, "▁children": -0.6319574117660522}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

Tommee Tippee said it will produce 500 cups after it searched factories worldwide and found the original mould. The firm's attention was drawn to the family's plight when Mr Carter launched the Twitter appeal to find a replacement. More on a dad's desperate search for a cup, and other stories His original plea prompted offers of help from as far away as Australia. Mr Carter, 42, said the response from well-wishers had been \"incredible\" and it was a \"huge surprise\" to be contacted by the manufacturer. Mr Carter said: \"For me it's massive. Some people think I'm exaggerating but without it he doesn't drink so personally I'm very relieved.\" Tommee Tippee will send the cups on demand for free to the Carter family. Mr Carter said: \"I would not be happier if I won the lottery. We've moved down to the middle of nowhere and don't want much. \"Just knowing he has got these cups gives us peace of mind.\" Northumberland-based Tommee Tippee does not normally keep the moulds but had been searching factories around the world in the hope of finding the original plans. A spokesman said: \"We are delighted to confirm that we are able to start production on a run of the original cup. \"This will ensure that Ben has a lifetime supply and that his family won't ever have to worry about finding another cup for Ben.\" Mr Carter, from Devon, told the BBC his son has had his current blue cup for three years, but it is now falling apart and may only last a few more weeks.

Jason Taylor, 21, of Westfield, Lostock Hall denied murder but was found guilty after a trial by jury. At Preston Court, he was ordered to serve a minimum of 25 years. Mr Wilson died as a result of catastrophic bleeding from a stab wound in his thigh, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said. Sophie Lorimer from the CPS North West said the \"brutal attack\" in front of his ex-partner was \"purely motivated by jealousy\". \"He could not accept that the relationship with his ex-girlfriend was over,\" she said. Taylor's girlfriend said he bombarded her with text messages and phone calls which \"progressively became more and more abusive\". \"The final text he sent to her stated he was giving her one last chance before things turned sour. \"Minutes later he violently broke into her house where Adam Wilson was also present.\" Ms Lorimer said Taylor then stabbed Mr Wilson numerous times with a large knife which he had taken with him. Taylor carried out the \"frenzied\" knife attack \"fully aware\" there were two young children also present at the house, she said.

College principal Chris Wilkes said the decision was related to \"low student numbers rather than any other reason\". He said it would continue to focus on adult education. Famous Ruskin College alumni include former deputy prime minister John Prescott and Dennis Skinner, MP for Bolsover in Derbyshire. BA English Studies, BA History with Social Sciences and MA Women's Studies are being discontinued. Anne Hughes, 63, from Thame in Oxfordshire, has been studying BA English Studies part-time at the college for two years. She said she was \"absolutely distraught\" it was being cut. She is physically disabled and has depression, and said she chose to study at the college because it worked with \"disadvantaged, disabled and mature students\". The college also offers bespoke timetables, unlike some other places of higher education, she added. Online petitions have been set up in a bid to save the English faculty and the Women's Studies course. One signatory, Jenny Lewis, wrote on the first petition: \"[Tutors] Helen Kidd and Tom Sherry are carrying on the great Ruskin tradition of bringing opportunities to those that otherwise would not have them.\" Student and activist Saskia Ritchie, who set up the second petition, said Ruskin had been set up for \"people who would traditionally be excluded from academia\" and gives \"access to truly excellent learning opportunities\". Mr Wilkes said the college would lose about 25 students as a result of the cuts. He added degrees had been on offer at the college for about 10 years and were \"relatively new\" considering the college's 116-year history. \"Our focus will continue to be on educating adults and I think what we're doing is just renewing our offer but doing it in a different way, fulfilling our mission in a different way, to perhaps how we've done it in the past,\" Mr Wilkes added. The college previously lost funding from the Skills Development Agency.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nA college in Oxford is cutting courses because of low student numbers.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "A", "▁college", "▁in", "▁Oxford", "▁is", "▁cutting", "▁courses", "▁because", "▁of", "▁low", "▁student", "▁numbers", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁A", "▁man", "▁who", "▁was", "▁shot", "▁by", "▁police", "▁in", "▁the", "▁head", "▁after", "▁a", "▁ch", "ase", "▁through", "▁the", "▁streets", "▁of", "▁a", "▁small", "▁town", "▁in", "▁the", "▁US", "▁state", "▁of", "▁Missouri", "▁on", "▁Monday", "▁has", "▁died", ",", "▁police", "▁said", ".", "▁Police", "▁said", "▁the", "▁man", ",", "▁identified", "▁as"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.1471189260482788, -0.0003477922291494906, -0.05651077255606651, -0.0005853846669197083, -0.039757318794727325, -0.17772197723388672, -0.27938613295555115, -0.2327466607093811, -0.006771119311451912, -0.013000020757317543, -9.893881360767409e-05, 0.0, -0.03975250571966171, -0.0013743727467954159, 0.0, -9.059865078597795e-06, 0.0, 0.0, -4.768370445162873e-07, 0.0, 0.0, -0.12196905165910721, -0.9067718982696533, -0.28102877736091614, -0.04489336162805557, -0.516526997089386, -0.04764755442738533, -0.17352531850337982, -0.33765730261802673, -0.701278567314148, -0.3339807987213135, -0.6018521189689636, -0.5682306289672852, -0.7813448309898376, 0.0, -0.1857900321483612, -0.5144550204277039, -0.0003014348621945828, -2.3841855067985307e-07, -0.04281501844525337, -0.047925081104040146, -0.00010430268594063818, -0.0013979434734210372, -0.8362663984298706, -0.023824717849493027, -0.01026942115277052, 0.0, -0.9909368753433228, -0.05190808326005936, -1.0616791248321533, -0.015679411590099335, -0.0029265929479151964, -0.032861776649951935, -0.537452220916748, -9.178694017464295e-05, -0.026351768523454666, -0.0500546395778656, -0.36517781019210815, -0.14046397805213928, -0.00531735410913825, -0.2555111050605774, -0.1771029233932495, -0.0019288521725684404], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "A": -0.1471189260482788, "▁college": -0.0003477922291494906, "▁in": -0.0013979434734210372, "▁Oxford": -0.0005853846669197083, "▁is": -0.039757318794727325, "▁cutting": -0.17772197723388672, "▁courses": -0.27938613295555115, "▁because": -0.2327466607093811, "▁of": 0.0, "▁low": -0.013000020757317543, "▁student": -9.893881360767409e-05, "▁numbers": 0.0, ".": -0.026351768523454666, "##": -9.059865078597795e-06, "#": 0.0, "Art": -4.768370445162873e-07, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "▁A": -0.12196905165910721, "▁man": -0.00531735410913825, "▁who": -0.28102877736091614, "▁was": -0.04489336162805557, "▁shot": -0.516526997089386, "▁by": -0.04764755442738533, "▁police": -0.537452220916748, "▁the": -0.14046397805213928, "▁head": -0.3339807987213135, "▁after": -0.6018521189689636, "▁a": -0.04281501844525337, "▁ch": -0.7813448309898376, "ase": 0.0, "▁through": -0.1857900321483612, "▁streets": -0.0003014348621945828, "▁small": -0.047925081104040146, "▁town": -0.00010430268594063818, "▁US": -0.023824717849493027, "▁state": -0.01026942115277052, "▁Missouri": -0.9909368753433228, "▁on": -0.05190808326005936, "▁Monday": -1.0616791248321533, "▁has": -0.015679411590099335, "▁died": -0.0029265929479151964, ",": -0.2555111050605774, "▁said": -0.36517781019210815, "▁Police": -0.0500546395778656, "▁identified": -0.1771029233932495, "▁as": -0.0019288521725684404}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

He was taken to hospital with a deep laceration to his shin and puncture wounds to his calf, but said he would not be put off playing golf. He told ABC News he would try not to hit balls into the water in future. Crocodiles are a common sight on the golf course, Australian media reported, and signs warn players of the dangers. Police Senior Sergeant James Coate told ABC that the 1.2m (4ft) saltwater crocodile had been in a waterway on the 11th hole Mr Lahiff, speaking from Cairns Hospital, said he had seen crocodiles there before and \"should have realised to be a bit more aware\". \"I didn't see the croc sunbaking just on the edge of the water. I walked past it and then it got me on the way back and as soon as it grabbed me it took off into the water.\" He manage to drive himself back to the club house to get help. The Australian newspaper reported that wildlife officers would try to remove the crocodile and relocate it to a crocodile farm or a zoo.

The Mental Health Network suspects the funding has been used to support other NHS services. NHS England says it can show where the money has been allocated. The additional funding was part of a £1.25bn investment over five years announced by the chancellor in the Budget in March 2015. While campaigners expected £250m to be made available this year, the Department of Health said in August that only £143m would be spent, as providers did not have the capacity to spend any more. However, the body representing mental health trusts says it has seen little of even that reduced amount. How the £143m was allocated: Source: NHS England Stephen Dalton, chief executive of the mental health network which represents NHS providers, said: \"Providers of mental health services and most importantly children and families are struggling to see the difference. \"It doesn't seem to have turned into posts on the front line. We are not hearing any reports of any significant investment at a local level around children's services. Indeed, some services are still experiencing cuts in services.\" NHS England says it has provided £75m to clinical commissioning groups (CCGs), but NHS providers fear some of the money has been siphoned off to pay for other services. Acknowledging that is a possibility, CCGs have told BBC News they want NHS England to ring-fence the money, specifically for children's mental health services. Dr Phil Moore, chairman of the NHS Clinical Commissioners Mental Health Commissioners Network, said: \"Despite our commitment to better mental healthcare for young people, it has to be acknowledged that CCGs are dealing with increasingly financially challenging times and a myriad of competing demands on budgets. \"This, combined with the fact that children and young people's mental healthcare is in desperate need of heavy investment having historically been treated as a 'Cinderella service', is why we believe this is a rare case where funding should be ring-fenced.\" Some trusts say they have seen additional funding - the South London and Maudsley, for instance, said they had received an additional £1.8m from four separate CCGs. And several CCGs told us they were committed to spending the money on new services. But some children's mental health services are also being cut, especially those provided by councils. Dr Marc Bush, senior policy adviser at the charity Young Minds, said: \"Our expectation is that overall spending on children's mental health services this year may either be flat or fall slightly in real terms.\" Former care minister Norman Lamb, who helped secure the extra funding, said he was concerned about the lack of progress. \"Given the pressure on the whole system including local government, there is a real risk that funding intended for children's mental health ends up elsewhere or simply replaces other funding cuts. \"There is an absolute moral imperative to address the very serious underfunding of children's mental health. Failure to invest this money now would be unforgivable.\" An NHS England spokesman said: \"As a society we must make\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nThe government has promised to invest more in children's mental health services.

Pwrpas y ddeddfwriaeth yw cynnig mwy o gefnogaeth i bobl sy'n byw gyda'r cyflwr. Mae'r mesur yn anelu at gyflwyno strategaeth ar gyfer diwallu anghenion plant ac oedolion yng Nghymru, a sicrhau bod cynghorau a byrddau iechyd yn deall ac yn cymryd y camau angenrheidiol er mwyn i blant ac oedolion dderbyn y cymorth sydd ei angen arnynt. Bydd pleidlais ar y Ddeddf Awtistiaeth yng Nghymru yn mynd ger bron aelodau'r cynulliad ddydd Mercher. Mabwysiadodd Cymru strategaeth awtistiaeth yn 2008 ac yn ddiweddar cafodd y strategaeth ei diweddaru i gynnwys targed amser aros penodol. Yr argymhelliad yw na fydd yn rhaid i blant ag awtistiaeth aros mwy na 26 wythnos cyn cael yr apwyntiad arbenigol cyntaf. Mae'r cynllun presennol ond yn para tan 2020. \"Be mae fy mil i'n ei wneud,\" medd Paul Davies, \"yw sicrhau bod y gwasanaethau yma yn fwy parhaol ynghyd â gosod sylfaen statudol i'r gwasanaethau.\" Er hynny, mae Steve Thomas, prif weithredwr Cymdeithas Llywodraeth Leol Cymru, wedi dweud wrth raglen Eye on Wales, BBC Radio Wales nad yw'n siwr bod angen deddfwriaeth o'r fath.

It also says they should not ratify a similar deal that has already been done between the EU and Canada. It says some aspects pose a threat to democracy and the rule of law. One of the concerns mentioned in the petition is the idea of tribunals that foreign investors would be able to use in some circumstances to sue governments. There is a great deal of controversy over exactly what this system, known as Investor State Dispute Settlement, would enable companies to do, but campaigners see it as an opportunity for international business to get compensation for government policy changes that adversely affect them. This kind of provision exists in many bilateral trade and investment agreements. Friends of the Earth have published new research on the impact they have had on EU countries. Information about these cases is not always made public, but the group says that going back to 1994, foreign investors have sought compensation of almost €30bn (£24bn) from 20 states. Where the results are known (a small minority of the total), the tribunals have awarded total compensation of €3.5bn (about £2.8bn). In Britain, the possible implications of this provision for the National Health Service have been especially controversial. Campaigners believe that the investor tribunals would make it harder to reverse any decisions to contract services out to international healthcare firms. John Hilary of War on Want said: TTIP \"will make it impossible for any future government to repeal the Health & Social Care Act and bring the NHS back into public hands\". The petition lists a number of other areas where its signatories believes European standards would suffer if the TTIP negotiations are completed and the Canada deal is ratified: employment, social, environmental, privacy and consumer protection. The European Commission says the EU will not have to sacrifice its high standards. It also says investor protection provisions are important for investment flows and have in general worked well. But it accepts there is a need for improvement and is trying to achieve that in its bilateral negotiations. The petition has been organised as an exercise called a European Citizens' Initiative which can lead to a public hearing in the European Parliament and require the European Commission to give a formal response explaining why it is accepting or rejecting what the petitioners call for. The European Commission has already said that the petition doesn't qualify as such an Initiative.

Some 20 courses have now been cancelled while authorities investigate. About 90 would-be students have been refunded. College director Haji Yunis told the BBC he was co-operating with inquiries. Secretly filmed footage had showed Mr Yunis laughing about the scam he presided over. He told the researcher that for Â£1,200 he would \"bring you in the back door\" and \"fast track\" him to a bodyguard qualification without any training. Mr Yunis told the researcher not to worry about the police. Fraudulent use of SIA cards in fact carries a maximum six-month prison sentence. Both the exam board whose certification was fraudulently obtained, Industry Qualifications (IQ), and the Security Industry Authority (SIA) are investigating the college. An audit is currently taking place, with the aim of ascertaining how many qualifications awarded at the college to enable security guards to become licensed by the SIA were bogus. Jobseekers must sit mandatory exams to get an SIA card. A statement placed on Ashley Commerce College's website by IQ read: \"Following the BBC broadcast, IQ has been working with the regulators Ofqual and the SIA to formulate a plan for identifying learners affected by the fraud. \"We do expect to find evidence that some learners have received their qualifications without having done their course or tests properly. These qualifications will be reviewed. \"We know that this will leave many learners who attended ACC worried about the authenticity of their qualifications and IQ is working hard to find out how many learners may be affected.\" The statement said every student who obtained an SIA licence through the college may be affected. The college has been operating since 2010. The statement added: \"Where we cannot guarantee that a qualification has not been affected by fraud, we are required to remove the qualification immediately and notify the Security Industry Authority.\" Mr Yunis would not say how many students' qualifications were now being reviewed. Keith Vaz MP, the chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, called the fraud a \"major scandal\". A Home Office spokesman has said any criminal behaviour would be addressed.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nAn undercover BBC investigation has exposed a college in London that was selling fake security guard qualifications to untrained students.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "An", "▁under", "cover", "▁BBC", "▁investigation", "▁has", "▁exposed", "▁a", "▁college", "▁in", "▁London", "▁that", "▁was", "▁s", "elling", "▁fake", "▁security", "▁guard", "▁qual", "ifications", "▁to", "▁un", "tra", "ined", "▁students", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁The", "▁", "1", "9", "9", "6", "▁film", "▁Jerry", "▁Mag", "u", "ire", "▁was", "▁a", "▁box", "▁office", "▁hit", "▁and", "▁has", "▁become", "▁a", "▁classic", "▁of", "▁American", "▁cinema", ".", "▁The", "▁film", "'", "s"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.36417216062545776, -0.07582961022853851, 0.0, -0.05837973579764366, -0.0013096098555251956, -0.004448399413377047, -0.563553512096405, -0.0014248467050492764, -1.1925933361053467, -0.0073585896752774715, -0.5041199922561646, -0.12622451782226562, -0.5259565114974976, -0.010670983232557774, 0.0, -0.004881488159298897, -0.01541626825928688, -0.004681697580963373, -0.014195182360708714, 0.0, -0.12888824939727783, -0.03752738982439041, -0.5063620805740356, 0.0, -0.0005712069687433541, -0.02669481188058853, -0.011134631000459194, 0.0, -3.6954811548639555e-06, 0.0, 0.0, -3.576278118089249e-07, 0.0, 0.0, -0.2593933343887329, -1.3214080333709717, -0.18236412107944489, -0.06839562952518463, -0.6082908511161804, -1.1663817167282104, -0.07467738538980484, -0.6026453971862793, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.7321733236312866, -0.01581318862736225, -0.028225867077708244, -1.9788545614574105e-05, -0.0075173829682171345, -0.13379447162151337, -0.42392098903656006, -0.11932890862226486, -0.01703968457877636, -0.04359467327594757, -0.972474217414856, -0.4467325806617737, -0.00011824862303910777, -0.0045916358940303326, -0.7340801358222961, -0.13989605009555817, -0.6129881739616394, 0.0], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "An": -0.36417216062545776, "▁under": -0.07582961022853851, "cover": 0.0, "▁BBC": -0.05837973579764366, "▁investigation": -0.0013096098555251956, "▁has": -0.42392098903656006, "▁exposed": -0.563553512096405, "▁a": -0.01703968457877636, "▁college": -1.1925933361053467, "▁in": -0.0073585896752774715, "▁London": -0.5041199922561646, "▁that": -0.12622451782226562, "▁was": -0.7321733236312866, "▁s": -0.010670983232557774, "elling": 0.0, "▁fake": -0.004881488159298897, "▁security": -0.01541626825928688, "▁guard": -0.004681697580963373, "▁qual": -0.014195182360708714, "ifications": 0.0, "▁to": -0.12888824939727783, "▁un": -0.03752738982439041, "tra": -0.5063620805740356, "ined": 0.0, "▁students": -0.0005712069687433541, ".": -0.0045916358940303326, "##": -3.6954811548639555e-06, "#": 0.0, "Art": -3.576278118089249e-07, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "▁The": -0.7340801358222961, "▁": -1.3214080333709717, "1": -0.18236412107944489, "9": -0.6082908511161804, "6": -1.1663817167282104, "▁film": -0.13989605009555817, "▁Jerry": -0.6026453971862793, "▁Mag": 0.0, "u": 0.0, "ire": 0.0, "▁box": -0.028225867077708244, "▁office": -1.9788545614574105e-05, "▁hit": -0.0075173829682171345, "▁and": -0.13379447162151337, "▁become": -0.11932890862226486, "▁classic": -0.04359467327594757, "▁of": -0.972474217414856, "▁American": -0.4467325806617737, "▁cinema": -0.00011824862303910777, "'": -0.6129881739616394, "s": 0.0}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

The Do Not Pay bot currently works in the UK and New York in the US. It asks a series of questions to determine the validity of a penalty notice. It can also be used to work out compensation for delayed flights. Mr Browder told the BBC he hoped it proved bots could be useful. \"Bots are a huge opportunity for public service,\" he said. \"I'm very surprised it has been so successful, but I am not surprised that so many people have pushed back against their parking tickets.\" Of the 160,000 successful challenges, 9,000 were from New York, where the bot launched in March 2016, reports Venture Beat. Mr Browder was inspired to build the bot, which he describes as \"the world's first robot lawyer\", after receiving \"countless\" parking tickets himself. It took him three months to program. The Stanford University student is currently building a new bot aimed at helping Syrian refugees by producing English documents based on Arabic text. However, Abhi Chirimar, the chief executive of online mental health community Instawell, said that in his experience there was no chatbot \"silver bullet\" for companies offering digital services across more than one platform. \"Service developers need to be mindful of the pros and cons when designing chatbots,\" he said. \"Chatbots need tactical conversation design to ensure that the average person feels comfortable throughout the process. \"We realised early on that there isn't an easy 'silver-bullet' for our chatbot. \"Now, a Facebook user and a Slack user are served up different chatbots for the same goal - get the right kind of help.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nA chatbot that helps people challenge parking tickets has been used 250,000 times in the UK and US.  \n\nArticle: 250,000 times.

Knightley, 28, announced her engagement to Righton, 29, last year. \"Keira was a charming bride, very modest and simple in her attitude, as was James,\" Mr Navello told the Daily Mail. \"I got the impression that it was a very moving experience for both of them.\" The actress, who was Oscar-nominated for her performance in 2005's Pride and Prejudice, is the daughter of playwright Sharman Macdonald and actor Will Knightley. She rose to fame in the British hit Bend it like Beckham, becoming an international star in films including Love Actually and the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. 'More interesting' Knightley also won critical acclaim for her performances in films such as Atonement, A Dangerous Method and, most recently, Anna Karenina. Later this year, she will be seen in Jack Ryan - a prequel to previous Tom Clancy adaptations - playing Cathy Ryan opposite Chris Pine. Singer and keyboard player Righton has performed with indie rock band the Klaxons since 2005. The group won a Mercury Music Prize in 2007 for their debut album Myths Of The Near Future. In an interview last month, Knightley said she did not want an extravagant wedding day. \"We're not 'big wedding' types. I don't need to have all that. I'm just trying to enjoy the engagement bit. \"My parents are together after 40 years. The fights are there but they love each other. \"It's not like the first three months, the first two years... whatever it is, but I think it gets more interesting, or I hope so.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nKeira Knightley married James Righton in a small ceremony in France.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "Ke", "ira", "▁Knight", "ley", "▁married", "▁James", "▁Right", "on", "▁in", "▁a", "▁small", "▁ceremony", "▁in", "▁France", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁The", "▁", "2", "0", "1", "3", "▁MTV", "▁Video", "▁Music", "▁Awards", "▁took", "▁place", "▁on", "▁Sunday", "▁night", "▁at", "▁the", "▁Bar", "cl", "ays", "▁Center", "▁in", "▁Brook", "lyn", ",", "▁New", "▁York", ".", "▁The", "▁show", "▁was", "▁hosted", "▁by", "▁M", "iley", "▁C", "yrus", "▁and", "▁featured", "▁performances"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.003072305815294385, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.5441934466362, -0.12859782576560974, 0.0, 0.0, -0.0003762729174923152, -0.007092536427080631, -0.004424425773322582, -0.001963831717148423, -3.015949550899677e-05, -0.1027974858880043, -0.09168748557567596, -0.036065828055143356, 0.0, -0.0008519833791069686, 0.0, 0.0, -5.960462772236497e-07, 0.0, 0.0, -0.14419516921043396, -0.08397134393453598, -0.21052788197994232, -0.15952491760253906, -0.035606008023023605, -0.500709056854248, -0.1993023157119751, -0.06255557388067245, 0.0, -6.890059739816934e-05, -0.7733013033866882, 0.0, -0.22735914587974548, -0.37727683782577515, -0.13156643509864807, -0.15904001891613007, -1.1920858014491387e-05, 0.0, 0.0, -5.602820692729438e-06, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -4.649054244509898e-05, -6.913899414939806e-05, 0.0, -0.004460386000573635, -0.0031509771943092346, 0.0, -0.0833485797047615, -0.060932666063308716, -0.023912131786346436, -0.003256971715018153, -0.0986185222864151, 0.0, -0.04391781985759735, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.02327689342200756, -0.003598050447180867, -0.08880463987588882], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "Ke": -0.003072305815294385, "ira": 0.0, "▁Knight": 0.0, "ley": 0.0, "▁married": -0.5441934466362, "▁James": -0.12859782576560974, "▁Right": 0.0, "on": 0.0, "▁in": -4.649054244509898e-05, "▁a": -0.007092536427080631, "▁small": -0.004424425773322582, "▁ceremony": -0.001963831717148423, "▁France": -0.1027974858880043, ".": -0.0833485797047615, "##": -0.0008519833791069686, "#": 0.0, "Art": -5.960462772236497e-07, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "▁The": -0.060932666063308716, "▁": -0.08397134393453598, "2": -0.21052788197994232, "0": -0.15952491760253906, "1": -0.035606008023023605, "3": -0.500709056854248, "▁MTV": -0.1993023157119751, "▁Video": -0.06255557388067245, "▁Music": 0.0, "▁Awards": -6.890059739816934e-05, "▁took": -0.7733013033866882, "▁place": 0.0, "▁on": -0.22735914587974548, "▁Sunday": -0.37727683782577515, "▁night": -0.13156643509864807, "▁at": -0.15904001891613007, "▁the": -1.1920858014491387e-05, "▁Bar": 0.0, "cl": 0.0, "ays": -5.602820692729438e-06, "▁Center": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "▁Brook": -6.913899414939806e-05, "lyn": 0.0, ",": -0.004460386000573635, "▁New": -0.0031509771943092346, "▁York": 0.0, "▁show": -0.023912131786346436, "▁was": -0.003256971715018153, "▁hosted": -0.0986185222864151, "▁by": 0.0, "▁M": -0.04391781985759735, "iley": 0.0, "▁C": 0.0, "yrus": 0.0, "▁and": -0.02327689342200756, "▁featured": -0.003598050447180867, "▁performances": -0.08880463987588882}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

The Australian Broadcasting Corp. quoted Sophia's grandmother, Vera Cook, who credited the dog with saving the toddler's life. She said that Sophia was wearing just a nappy and T-shirt when she wandered off. \"The only thing I was thinking was well, hopefully the dog would have kept her warm,\" Ms Cook was quoted as saying. \"If [the dog] wasn't with her, I don't know whether they would have found her.\" The family issued a statement thanking emergency services and promising that Poppy would be \"well fed this evening\".\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\nA pet dog is being credited with keeping a little girl safe after the pair wandered away from their family home and could not be found for hours.\n\n###\nArticle: Uptown Funk, which topped the UK chart for seven weeks and the US chart for 14, originally had six songwriters. The five writers of The Gap Band's hit were added earlier this week, according to RCA documents seen by Billboard. It's said to have followed a claim from publisher Minder Music on their behalf. The much-publicised Blurred Lines court case in March saw a jury order the track's writers, Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams, to pay Marvin Gaye's estate $7.4m (Â£4.8m) in damages because of its similarities with Gaye's 1977 hit Got to Give It Up. Uptown Funk's original writers were listed as Ronson and Mars, plus co-producer Jeffrey Bhasker and Phillip Lawrence from Mars' production team The Smeezingtons. Nicholas Williams - aka rapper Trinidad James - and producer Devon Gallaspy also got a credit for the use of a sample of James' track All Gold Everything. They have now been joined by the five writers of The Gap Band's hit: band members Charlie, Robert and Ronnie Wilson and keyboardist Rudolph Taylor, plus producer Lonnie Simmons. Billboard said a lawyer for James's manager Danny Zook agreed the Blurred Lines case may have influenced the Uptown Funk writers' decision. \"Everyone is being a little more cautious. Nobody wants to be involved in a lawsuit,\" he told Billboard. It is believed the claim from Minder Music was filed with YouTube's content management system in February. Vick Bain, CEO of The British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors (BASCA), told the BBC that original songwriters \"absolutely deserve proper credit\". \"However it does get very blurred when people take inspiration,\" said Ms Bain. \"We can understand why Ronson and Mars wanted to avoid a very expensive court case, but I'm sure they would not have given credit if they hadn't felt that would be the right thing to do.\" Ms Bain said BASCA hoped all songwriters could avoid expensive court cases in the future, with the Blurred Lines case setting a \"dangerous precedent\". \"One of our members, who is an expert musicologist, he looked at it and said, 'in this country they wouldn't have won',\" she continued - referring to the way the jury made its decision based on sheet music of Gaye's hit. Echoing the comments of Pharrell Williams after the verdict, she said: \"It sets a very sad and dangerous precedent, because all composers and all songwriters for hundreds of years have been influenced by everyone around them. So I really hope it doesn't stifle creativity.\" In January, Sam Smith agreed to pay Tom Petty songwriting royalties for his single Stay With Me, because of its similarities to Petty's 1989 track I Won't Back Down. A spokesman for Smith said the singer \"acknowledged the similarity\" but said the likeness was \"a complete coincidence\".\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nA song by Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars has been updated to include five songwriters of a 1970s hit by The Gap Band, following a claim from the band's publisher.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "A", "▁song", "▁by", "▁Mark", "▁R", "ons", "on", "▁and", "▁Bruno", "▁Mars", "▁has", "▁been", "▁updated", "▁to", "▁include", "▁five", "▁song", "writ", "ers", "▁of", "▁a", "▁", "1", "9", "7", "0", "s", "▁hit", "▁by", "▁The", "▁G", "ap", "▁Band", ",", "▁following", "▁a", "▁claim", "▁from", "▁the", "▁band", "'", "s", "▁publish", "er", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁The", "▁", "2", "0", "1", "7", "▁MTV", "▁Video", "▁Music", "▁Awards"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.3673248291015625, -0.027601828798651695, -0.6950780749320984, -0.5074321031570435, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.0005156855913810432, 0.0, 0.0, -0.013866164721548557, -0.035284996032714844, -0.29551512002944946, -0.010277916677296162, -0.00014876213390380144, -0.5084478259086609, -0.762992799282074, -4.768370445162873e-07, 0.0, -0.1960480809211731, -0.34460657835006714, -0.09301843494176865, -1.6689286894688848e-06, 0.0, -2.50339189733495e-06, -0.3854478597640991, -3.6954811548639555e-06, -0.005734184291213751, -0.014390379190444946, -0.12015561014413834, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.5279328227043152, -0.36113032698631287, -0.00045468006283044815, -0.021621350198984146, -0.05462939292192459, -0.31680017709732056, -0.11913252621889114, -1.2993727978027891e-05, 0.0, -0.0013372297398746014, -0.0019286142196506262, -0.0006884350441396236, -0.011534903198480606, 0.0, -0.004908179398626089, 0.0, 0.0, -1.311301275563892e-06, 0.0, 0.0, -0.07846177369356155, -0.34651297330856323, -0.3785978853702545, -0.0024330795276910067, -0.0005726366653107107, -0.15313313901424408, -0.6609007716178894, -0.05784118175506592, 0.0, -1.2993727978027891e-05], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "A": -0.3673248291015625, "▁song": -0.762992799282074, "▁by": -0.014390379190444946, "▁Mark": -0.5074321031570435, "▁R": 0.0, "ons": 0.0, "on": 0.0, "▁and": -0.0005156855913810432, "▁Bruno": 0.0, "▁Mars": 0.0, "▁has": -0.013866164721548557, "▁been": -0.035284996032714844, "▁updated": -0.29551512002944946, "▁to": -0.010277916677296162, "▁include": -0.00014876213390380144, "▁five": -0.5084478259086609, "writ": -4.768370445162873e-07, "ers": 0.0, "▁of": -0.1960480809211731, "▁a": -0.00045468006283044815, "▁": -0.34651297330856323, "1": -0.0005726366653107107, "9": 0.0, "7": -0.15313313901424408, "0": -0.0024330795276910067, "s": 0.0, "▁hit": -0.005734184291213751, "▁The": -0.07846177369356155, "▁G": 0.0, "ap": 0.0, "▁Band": 0.0, ",": -0.5279328227043152, "▁following": -0.36113032698631287, "▁claim": -0.021621350198984146, "▁from": -0.05462939292192459, "▁the": -0.31680017709732056, "▁band": -0.11913252621889114, "'": -1.2993727978027891e-05, "▁publish": -0.0013372297398746014, "er": -0.0019286142196506262, ".": -0.0006884350441396236, "##": -0.004908179398626089, "#": 0.0, "Art": -1.311301275563892e-06, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "2": -0.3785978853702545, "▁MTV": -0.6609007716178894, "▁Video": -0.05784118175506592, "▁Music": 0.0, "▁Awards": -1.2993727978027891e-05}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

The dog, a one-year-old Australian sheepdog named Poppy, went with her. Police confirmed that Poppy's barking alerted rescuers to the whereabouts of the pair after a seven-hour search. Rescuers found Sophia and Poppy 200m from a dam on the family's property. The Australian Broadcasting Corp. quoted Sophia's grandmother, Vera Cook, who credited the dog with saving the toddler's life. She said that Sophia was wearing just a nappy and T-shirt when she wandered off. \"The only thing I was thinking was well, hopefully the dog would have kept her warm,\" Ms Cook was quoted as saying. \"If [the dog] wasn't with her, I don't know whether they would have found her.\" The family issued a statement thanking emergency services and promising that Poppy would be \"well fed this evening\".\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\nA pet dog is being credited with keeping a little girl safe after the pair wandered away from their family home and could not be found for hours.\n\n###\nArticle: About 50 weddings due to take place after 10 April at Manor Barn in Buriton have been cancelled. Owner Bob Camping said he was \"so very sorry\". His other firm The Village Inn/Goosebumps Weddings Ltd is currently in receivership. One affected couple described it as a \"nightmare\". Mr Camping has vowed to sell his home and the business \"and pay people back immediately\". Nicholas Pettit and Gemma Brown were due to marry at the barn in September and said they had been left \"devastated\" by the news. \"We are now having to come to terms with not having our wedding where we initially wanted and being £2,000 out of pocket,\" Mr Pettit added. Mr Camping said other weddings due to take place before 10 April, including that of Jade Nias and Kyle Hillman, would be honoured. But Miss Nias and Mr Hillman said they had now chosen another venue. Mr Hillman said he had worked \"countless hours of overtime\" to pay the £2,000 deposit for Manor Barn, adding: \"It just feels like that time has been wasted.\" Claire Moulder and Jason Ledwith are due to marry at the venue in March and said uncertainty surrounding the venue had caused them \"great stress, worry and sleepless nights, and is a sheer nightmare\". Manor Barn's licence is also being reviewed by East Hampshire District Council over noise complaints. One of the proposed conditions at the venue in Buriton is for a \"sound limiting device\" to be installed, the council said. Mr Camping said this would cost £500,000, which he added was unaffordable and unrealistic.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nA wedding venue has been forced to cancel dozens of weddings due to financial problems .  \n\n[INST] Write a title for this article: A man who was shot in the head during a home invasion in the Bronx has died, police said Friday .  \n\nA ma", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "A", "▁wed", "ding", "▁ven", "ue", "▁has", "▁been", "▁forced", "▁to", "▁cancel", "▁do", "z", "ens", "▁of", "▁wed", "d", "ings", "▁due", "▁to", "▁financial", "▁problems", "▁.", "▁▁", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "[", "INST", "]", "▁Write", "▁a", "▁title", "▁for", "▁this", "▁article", ":", "▁A", "▁man", "▁who", "▁was", "▁shot", "▁in", "▁the", "▁head", "▁during", "▁a", "▁home", "▁invasion", "▁in", "▁the", "▁Bron", "x", "▁has", "▁died", ",", "▁police", "▁said", "▁Friday", "▁.", "▁▁", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "A", "▁man"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.118815116584301, -0.0014828173443675041, 0.0, -1.0371154530730564e-05, 0.0, -0.1998501718044281, -0.050390440970659256, -0.6242388486862183, -4.768370445162873e-07, -0.0012722263345494866, -0.9919736385345459, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.053909238427877426, -2.50339189733495e-06, 0.0, -0.08800149708986282, 0.0, -0.01639900729060173, -0.08090716600418091, -0.6973802447319031, -0.015563576482236385, 0.0, 0.0, -0.5131228566169739, -3.576278118089249e-07, 0.0, -0.7730123996734619, -0.004553781822323799, -0.0005905076395720243, -3.576278118089249e-07, -1.6689286894688848e-06, -1.1920922133867862e-06, 0.0, -1.306274652481079, -0.746632993221283, -0.20275945961475372, -0.10045664012432098, -0.394298255443573, -0.03139025717973709, -4.827859811484814e-05, -0.013898377306759357, -0.560209333896637, -0.027578983455896378, -0.4893561601638794, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -0.08705970644950867, -0.4351135492324829, -0.001949435449205339, 0.0, -0.8884372711181641, -0.1875658482313156, -0.05706895515322685, -0.00827384926378727, -1.1205610462639015e-05, -0.7603824138641357, -0.023327670991420746, -0.6200578808784485, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -0.010596085339784622, -0.3715205788612366, -0.17547287046909332], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": -0.010596085339784622, "A": -0.3715205788612366, "▁wed": -0.053909238427877426, "ding": 0.0, "▁ven": -1.0371154530730564e-05, "ue": 0.0, "▁has": -0.8884372711181641, "▁been": -0.050390440970659256, "▁forced": -0.6242388486862183, "▁to": 0.0, "▁cancel": -0.0012722263345494866, "▁do": -0.9919736385345459, "z": 0.0, "ens": 0.0, "▁of": 0.0, "d": -2.50339189733495e-06, "ings": 0.0, "▁due": -0.08800149708986282, "▁financial": -0.01639900729060173, "▁problems": -0.08090716600418091, "▁.": -0.023327670991420746, "▁▁": -0.6200578808784485, "[": -0.5131228566169739, "INST": -3.576278118089249e-07, "]": 0.0, "▁Write": -0.7730123996734619, "▁a": -0.027578983455896378, "▁title": -0.0005905076395720243, "▁for": -3.576278118089249e-07, "▁this": -1.6689286894688848e-06, "▁article": -1.1920922133867862e-06, ":": 0.0, "▁A": -1.306274652481079, "▁man": -0.17547287046909332, "▁who": -0.20275945961475372, "▁was": -0.10045664012432098, "▁shot": -0.394298255443573, "▁in": -0.08705970644950867, "▁the": -0.4351135492324829, "▁head": -0.013898377306759357, "▁during": -0.560209333896637, "▁home": -0.4893561601638794, "▁invasion": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "▁Bron": -0.001949435449205339, "x": 0.0, "▁died": -0.1875658482313156, ",": -0.05706895515322685, "▁police": -0.00827384926378727, "▁said": -1.1205610462639015e-05, "▁Friday": -0.7603824138641357}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

However, it appealed against an attempt to access police documents. Judges dismissed the appeal and said it was hard to contemplate a more grave subject matter. Mr Flynn has said the PSNI did not fully examine claims of security force collusion with loyalists. A notorious UVF unit, based in Mount Vernon, north Belfast, is believed to be responsible for two attempts to murder Mr Flynn. A gunman tried to ambush him as he picked up a taxi fare, and a bomb was placed under his car. It is alleged the attacker was a police informer. The PSNI argued that it had already admitted liability in the case and that producing the documents would be irrelevant, costly and divert resources from other cases. However, judges at the appeal court said the full extent of police misconduct needed to be established before compensation for Mr Flynn can be decided. The judges said discovery of documents in the case has a long and tortuous history, and that the PSNI should provide the papers as quickly as possible. Mr Flynn's claim is linked to an investigation in 2007 by former police ombudsman, Nuala O'Loan. That report found that members of the RUC Special Branch had allowed UVF informers to act with impunity, and that the Mount Vernon gang may have been involved in up to 15 murders. Mr Flynn claimed Mrs O'Loan's successor, Al Hutchinson, did not adequately implement recommendations from the 2007 report to examine whether agents' handlers committed any crimes.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nA man who survived two attempts on his life by loyalist paramilitaries in the 1990s is seeking access to police documents which he believes will show that the police colluded with the loyalists .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "A", "▁man", "▁who", "▁surv", "ived", "▁two", "▁attempts", "▁on", "▁his", "▁life", "▁by", "▁loyal", "ist", "▁par", "amil", "itar", "ies", "▁in", "▁the", "▁", "1", "9", "9", "0", "s", "▁is", "▁seeking", "▁access", "▁to", "▁police", "▁documents", "▁which", "▁he", "▁bel", "ieves", "▁will", "▁show", "▁that", "▁the", "▁police", "▁coll", "ud", "ed", "▁with", "▁the", "▁loyal", "ists", "▁.", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.0821056142449379, -0.655165433883667, -0.0996638759970665, -0.7472687363624573, 0.0, -6.198863957251888e-06, -0.0037070857360959053, -0.01071627251803875, 0.0, 0.0, -0.2587677240371704, -0.06258155405521393, -0.010168887674808502, -0.016034699976444244, 0.0, -0.00036459474358707666, 0.0, -0.9832161664962769, -0.00013684290752280504, -3.0278701160568744e-05, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.507707953453064, -0.23484762012958527, -0.3773094713687897, 0.0, -0.0011524471919983625, -0.026109768077731133, -0.9839861392974854, -0.00012051333033014089, -0.38984090089797974, 0.0, -0.002563525689765811, -0.6383857727050781, -0.3608018755912781, -0.9864531755447388, -0.12977461516857147, -0.09859832376241684, 0.0, 0.0, -4.541770613286644e-05, -0.03508439660072327, -0.006488210055977106, -0.0008386432309634984, -0.19188222289085388, -0.0797954574227333, 0.0, -0.035804543644189835, -0.0004228651523590088, -0.00017808281700126827, -9.775113539944869e-06, -7.784063927829266e-05, -6.198863957251888e-06, -2.9802276912960224e-06, -1.0728830375228426e-06, -4.768370445162873e-07, -3.576278118089249e-07, -4.768370445162873e-07, -3.576278118089249e-07, -2.3841855067985307e-07], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": -2.3841855067985307e-07, "A": -0.0821056142449379, "▁man": -0.655165433883667, "▁who": -0.0996638759970665, "▁surv": -0.7472687363624573, "ived": 0.0, "▁two": -6.198863957251888e-06, "▁attempts": -0.0037070857360959053, "▁on": -0.01071627251803875, "▁his": 0.0, "▁life": 0.0, "▁by": -0.2587677240371704, "▁loyal": -0.006488210055977106, "ist": -0.010168887674808502, "▁par": -0.016034699976444244, "amil": 0.0, "itar": -0.00036459474358707666, "ies": 0.0, "▁in": -0.9832161664962769, "▁the": -0.03508439660072327, "▁": -3.0278701160568744e-05, "1": 0.0, "9": 0.0, "0": 0.0, "s": 0.0, "▁is": -0.507707953453064, "▁seeking": -0.23484762012958527, "▁access": -0.3773094713687897, "▁to": 0.0, "▁police": -0.12977461516857147, "▁documents": -0.026109768077731133, "▁which": -0.9839861392974854, "▁he": -0.00012051333033014089, "▁bel": -0.38984090089797974, "ieves": 0.0, "▁will": -0.002563525689765811, "▁show": -0.6383857727050781, "▁that": -0.3608018755912781, "▁coll": -0.09859832376241684, "ud": 0.0, "ed": 0.0, "▁with": -4.541770613286644e-05, "ists": -0.0008386432309634984, "▁.": -0.19188222289085388}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

Lee, 84, has never explained why she stopped writing. She doesn't give interviews - \"Hell, no\" was her response to a request several decades ago - and that silence has only added to the intrigue. But her close friend Thomas Lane Butts, a retired minister in her hometown, Monroeville, Alabama, says she once told him the reason. Sitting on a pew in the Methodist church which the Lee family still attends, he described to me how she suddenly brought the subject up one night over dinner in New York. \"She asked me, 'You ever wonder why I didn't write anything else?' And I said, 'Along with several million other people, yes, I had wondered about that.' And she said, 'Well, what do you think?'\" Speaking in his slow southern drawl, the Rev Butts, who just turned 80, suggested to her that she had already written a great book and therefore didn't need to compete with herself. \"And when I got through she said, 'You're all wrong.' I said, 'Alright, smart Alec. You tell me.' She said, 'I would not go through all the deprivation of privacy through which I went for this book again for any amount of money.' \"And she said, 'I did not need to write another book. I said what I wanted to say in that book.'\" Harper Lee called it a simple tale about the \"conflict of the human soul\" and Monroeville, Alabama, is where she drew her inspiration. The story depicts the segregated South of her childhood, during the Depression. It was published at the height of the civil rights struggle. The Rev Butts grew up 10 miles outside Monroeville. By the late 1950s, he says, he was a \"fuzzy-cheeked young preacher\" campaigning for an end to segregation. He had met Martin Luther King Jr and signed a petition to boycott buses. The Ku Klux Klan had left a burning cross on his front lawn. He says To Kill a Mockingbird was not well received in Monroeville when it was published. \"The people who were hard racist did not like it because of the implication of the book,\" the Rev Butts told me. \"The book revealed racism and that always frightens a racist - when you pull the cover off them. \"Those of us who stood up for civil rights were much encouraged by the book because in a very skilful and subtle way it addressed itself for justice.\" But these days, the Rev Butts says, there is enormous civic pride in Monroeville. The old courthouse, which Hollywood re-created for the film, now houses a museum to Harper Lee and the town's other literary icon, Truman Capote. Capote was a childhood friend of hers and is thought to be the inspiration for the Dill character in To Kill a Mockingbird. The town's residents often try to protect Lee, allowing her to live a normal life instead of being hounded by fans or bothered with prying questions. \"Being famous\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nHarper Lee's classic was published 50 years ago this summer and it remains the only novel she ever wrote.

Chief magistrate Emma Arbuthnot said she had \"no doubt it was menacing\". Philipps, who called his comments \"satire\", faces a custodial sentence. He was found guilty of two counts of making malicious communications and acquitted of a third at Westminster Magistrates' Court. One of the counts related to a post regarding Ms Miller, published on Facebook on 7 November 2016, which said: \"Â£5,000 for the first person to 'accidentally' run over this bloody troublesome first generation immigrant.\" Philipps, of Knightsbridge, London, described her as a \"boat jumper\" and added: \"If this is what we should expect from immigrants, send them back to their stinking jungles.\" Ms Arbuthnot found this offence was racially aggravated. The court heard how Ms Miller, 52, said she felt \"violated\" by Philipps's \"shocking\" comments about her. Ms Miller led a successful legal challenge which, on 3 November, resulted in the government being told to consult Parliament before formally beginning the Brexit process. Philipps, who defended himself throughout the trial, said his posts had been simply reflecting how he and others felt following this ruling in the High Court. He told the court: \"My family motto is 'Love of Country is my motivation'.\" He said his comments were \"meant to be a form of satire, a literary technique, iterated in my personal style, which may not be to everyone's taste, but is understood and accepted by everyone who knows me\". Ms Arbuthnot, in a series of exchanges with the peer, asked Philipps: \"Boat jumper, how can I see that as anything other than a racial, ethnic aggravation?\" But Philipps denied the allegation that his posts were \"racially aggravated\" saying that describing Ms Miller as a \"boat jumper\" and that she should go back to the \"steaming jungle\" were \"statements of fact not a racist comment at all\". He added that he would not have made any serious threat \"on an account where I could easily be identified\". He added he had deleted the posts as soon as he realised that his closed circle of Facebook friends had been \"infiltrated\" and screen shots of the posts had been passed to Ms Miller. Delivering her verdict, Ms Arbuthnot said there was \"nothing private about a Facebook post\". The other post Philipps was convicted for was in response to a news article about an immigrant in Luton, who was involved in a row over housing. Philipps wrote: \"I will open the bidding. Â£2,000 in cash for the first person to carve Arnold Sube into pieces.\" Kate Mulholland, from the Crown Prosecution Service said: \"No-one should have these kind of menacing comments made to them or about them.\" Philipps will be sentenced later this week.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nA peer is facing a jail sentence after he was found guilty of making malicious communications against a prominent Brexit campaigner.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "A", "▁peer", "▁is", "▁facing", "▁a", "▁j", "ail", "▁sentence", "▁after", "▁he", "▁was", "▁found", "▁guilty", "▁of", "▁making", "▁mal", "icious", "▁communic", "ations", "▁against", "▁a", "▁prominent", "▁Bre", "x", "it", "▁campaign", "er", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁A", "▁woman", "▁who", "▁was", "▁alleg", "edly", "▁ra", "ped", "▁by", "▁a", "▁man", "▁she", "▁met", "▁on", "▁a", "▁d", "ating", "▁app", "▁has", "▁been", "▁ja", "iled", "▁for", "▁", "1", "2", "▁months"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -1.6689160474925302e-05, -0.07136912643909454, -0.4738789200782776, -0.026545768603682518, -0.05271370708942413, -0.16199487447738647, 0.0, -0.010168887674808502, -0.03505677357316017, -0.516269862651825, -0.027828743681311607, -0.5063580274581909, -2.3841855067985307e-07, -5.960462772236497e-07, -0.015923598781228065, -0.05194463953375816, 0.0, -0.17409449815750122, 0.0, -0.09986142814159393, -0.014503296464681625, -0.6097163558006287, -0.0017602439038455486, 0.0, -0.0012718691723421216, -0.0012722263345494866, 0.0, -0.007437634747475386, -0.07899297028779984, 0.0, -0.00016378014697693288, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.12245074659585953, -0.8245497941970825, -0.2778680920600891, -0.024867258965969086, -0.9236334562301636, -3.576278118089249e-07, -0.10790809243917465, -1.6689286894688848e-06, -0.028467588126659393, -0.010312840342521667, -0.15985435247421265, -0.08955057710409164, -0.00029559535323642194, -0.003149075899273157, -0.4458147883415222, -0.0008180370787158608, 0.0, -0.023289820179343224, -0.012254423461854458, -0.032614078372716904, -0.7087920904159546, 0.0, -0.00016127715934999287, -0.07009083777666092, -0.025263352319598198, -0.8490375280380249, -0.1644514501094818], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "A": -1.6689160474925302e-05, "▁peer": -0.07136912643909454, "▁is": -0.4738789200782776, "▁facing": -0.026545768603682518, "▁a": -0.4458147883415222, "▁j": -0.16199487447738647, "ail": 0.0, "▁sentence": -0.010168887674808502, "▁after": -0.03505677357316017, "▁he": -0.516269862651825, "▁was": -0.024867258965969086, "▁found": -0.5063580274581909, "▁guilty": -2.3841855067985307e-07, "▁of": -5.960462772236497e-07, "▁making": -0.015923598781228065, "▁mal": -0.05194463953375816, "icious": 0.0, "▁communic": -0.17409449815750122, "ations": 0.0, "▁against": -0.09986142814159393, "▁prominent": -0.6097163558006287, "▁Bre": -0.0017602439038455486, "x": 0.0, "it": -0.0012718691723421216, "▁campaign": -0.0012722263345494866, "er": 0.0, ".": -0.007437634747475386, "##": -0.00016378014697693288, "#": 0.0, "Art": 0.0, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "▁A": -0.12245074659585953, "▁woman": -0.8245497941970825, "▁who": -0.2778680920600891, "▁alleg": -0.9236334562301636, "edly": -3.576278118089249e-07, "▁ra": -0.10790809243917465, "ped": -1.6689286894688848e-06, "▁by": -0.028467588126659393, "▁man": -0.15985435247421265, "▁she": -0.08955057710409164, "▁met": -0.00029559535323642194, "▁on": -0.003149075899273157, "▁d": -0.0008180370787158608, "ating": 0.0, "▁app": -0.023289820179343224, "▁has": -0.012254423461854458, "▁been": -0.032614078372716904, "▁ja": -0.7087920904159546, "iled": 0.0, "▁for": -0.00016127715934999287, "▁": -0.07009083777666092, "1": -0.025263352319598198, "2": -0.8490375280380249, "▁months": -0.1644514501094818}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

The 14-time major winner had back surgery in September and October 2015. \"It's going to be a hard grind to come back and compete against the best in the world,\" said Briton Faldo, 59. Faldo was \"not surprised\" when the world number 786 withdrew from the PGA Tour opener on Monday. The 40-year-old has not won on the Tour since 2013 and sits on 79 victories, three behind the all-time record held by fellow American Sam Snead. Faldo told BBC Sport: \"Golf is a wicked game, it dangles a carrot. \"Ten years ago, I'd hit balls and think, 'I can still play, I can still hit it'. Then you'd go to the course and can't make a score. Everything is stacking up against him now. Physically, mentally and obviously competing.\" Woods was a vice-captain for the United States as they beat Europe to win the Ryder Cup earlier this month, but Faldo thought he looked like he was \"struggling just getting in and out of the golf buggie\". The Englishman added: \"Watching him walk, he just doesn't look supple to me. \"I know the stamina needed to play 72 holes. He may be able to hit balls on a range, but there's a rhythm to that. \"On a course, you get a five-minute gap between two shots. I think maybe he is starting to hit the ball better, but it's the stamina to play.\" Woods will also miss the Turkish Airlines Open in November but said he may be ready for his foundation's event, the Hero World Challenge, in December.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nTiger Woods has withdrawn from the Safeway Open due to his back injury .  \n\n[INST] Write a title for this article: The 16-year-old is the youngest player to win the women's title at the Australian Open since Evonne Goola", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "T", "iger", "▁Wood", "s", "▁has", "▁with", "dra", "wn", "▁from", "▁the", "▁Saf", "ew", "ay", "▁Open", "▁due", "▁to", "▁his", "▁back", "▁injury", "▁.", "▁▁", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "[", "INST", "]", "▁Write", "▁a", "▁title", "▁for", "▁this", "▁article", ":", "▁The", "▁", "1", "6", "-", "year", "-", "old", "▁is", "▁the", "▁young", "est", "▁player", "▁to", "▁win", "▁the", "▁women", "'", "s", "▁title", "▁at", "▁the", "▁Australian", "▁Open", "▁since", "▁Ev", "onne", "▁G", "ool", "ag"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.2521231472492218, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.028663842007517815, -0.17367713153362274, -1.6689286894688848e-06, 0.0, 0.0, -0.3615169823169708, -0.0067657907493412495, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.383767306804657, 0.0, -0.3257685601711273, -0.27899226546287537, -0.010623332113027573, -0.021646663546562195, -0.11515549570322037, 0.0, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -0.17481359839439392, 0.0, 0.0, -0.13854120671749115, -0.02341163530945778, -0.0013946102699264884, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -5.602820692729438e-06, -0.0008390005677938461, 0.0, -0.834377110004425, -1.0497937202453613, -0.382161408662796, -1.0170862674713135, -0.5066724419593811, -5.483612312673358e-06, -3.158996332786046e-05, 0.0, -1.1432323455810547, -0.07486278563737869, -0.6047807931900024, 0.0, -0.038119103759527206, -0.011369557119905949, -0.2513973116874695, -0.5065658092498779, -0.7849850654602051, -8.583032467868179e-06, 0.0, -0.2032342255115509, -0.49469485878944397, -0.0031247143633663654, -0.1674933284521103, -3.3378546504536644e-06, -0.40428051352500916, -0.09640870988368988, -3.576278118089249e-07, -1.1920928244535389e-07, 0.0, 0.0], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "T": -0.2521231472492218, "iger": 0.0, "▁Wood": 0.0, "s": 0.0, "▁has": -0.028663842007517815, "▁with": -0.17367713153362274, "dra": -1.6689286894688848e-06, "wn": 0.0, "▁from": 0.0, "▁the": -0.0031247143633663654, "▁Saf": -0.0067657907493412495, "ew": 0.0, "ay": 0.0, "▁Open": -3.3378546504536644e-06, "▁due": -0.383767306804657, "▁to": -0.011369557119905949, "▁his": -0.3257685601711273, "▁back": -0.27899226546287537, "▁injury": -0.010623332113027573, "▁.": -0.021646663546562195, "▁▁": -0.11515549570322037, "[": -0.17481359839439392, "INST": 0.0, "]": 0.0, "▁Write": -0.13854120671749115, "▁a": -0.02341163530945778, "▁title": -0.2032342255115509, "▁for": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "▁this": -5.602820692729438e-06, "▁article": -0.0008390005677938461, ":": 0.0, "▁The": -0.834377110004425, "▁": -1.0497937202453613, "1": -0.382161408662796, "6": -1.0170862674713135, "-": -3.158996332786046e-05, "year": -5.483612312673358e-06, "old": 0.0, "▁is": -1.1432323455810547, "▁young": -0.6047807931900024, "est": 0.0, "▁player": -0.038119103759527206, "▁win": -0.2513973116874695, "▁women": -0.7849850654602051, "'": -8.583032467868179e-06, "▁at": -0.49469485878944397, "▁Australian": -0.1674933284521103, "▁since": -0.40428051352500916, "▁Ev": -0.09640870988368988, "onne": -3.576278118089249e-07, "▁G": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "ool": 0.0, "ag": 0.0}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

It will be a very important game.\" Forest, two-time European Cup winners under Brian Clough in 1979 and 1980, who also guided the club to its four League Cup titles, last featured in European competition in the 1995-96 season, reaching the Uefa Cup quarter-finals. The Reds, who last won the League Cup in 1990 and featured in the final in 1992, were knocked out of the competition by League One side Walsall 12 months ago. Their trip to face League Two side Doncaster comes three days after Montanier oversaw Forest's Championship season opening victory against Burton Albion, in what was his first competitive match in English football. Former Rennes boss Montanier also confirmed that the injury to goalkeeper Dorus de Vries, suffered in the 4-3 victory over Burton on Saturday, is not as bad as first feared. \"It will be a few weeks, but not serious,\" Montanier said.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\n\nFour-time cup winners Forest have failed to progress past the third round for the past 11 seasons and start their campaign at Doncaster on Tuesday. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "F", "our", "-", "time", "▁cup", "▁w", "inners", "▁Forest", "▁have", "▁failed", "▁to", "▁progress", "▁past", "▁the", "▁third", "▁round", "▁for", "▁the", "▁past", "▁", "1", "1", "▁seasons", "▁and", "▁start", "▁their", "▁campaign", "▁at", "▁Don", "c", "aster", "▁on", "▁T", "ues", "day", ".", "▁", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.11857956647872925, -0.7940195798873901, -0.00011431517486926168, -0.010745756328105927, 0.0, -1.8596476365928538e-05, -1.9788545614574105e-05, 0.0, -0.0005529781919904053, -0.8342113494873047, -2.50339189733495e-06, 0.0, -1.8715683836489916e-05, -1.1920928244535389e-07, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -1.1920922133867862e-06, -5.602820692729438e-06, -4.768370445162873e-07, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.0003110878460574895, -0.00010513706365600228, 0.0, -1.6927575416048057e-05, -8.583032467868179e-06, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -8.583032467868179e-06, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.035087160766124725, -0.5392757654190063, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -1.9073468138230965e-06, -0.017514212056994438, -0.006013751961290836, -0.47047799825668335, -0.019162412732839584, -0.04135934263467789, -0.0012747265864163637, -0.00024184639914892614, -0.00010549465514486656, -4.589452510117553e-05, -3.0278701160568744e-05, -2.002696055569686e-05, -1.9907753085135482e-05, -8.583032467868179e-06, -5.602820692729438e-06, -3.6954811548639555e-06, -2.50339189733495e-06, -1.6689286894688848e-06, -1.0728830375228426e-06, -7.152555099310121e-07, -4.768370445162873e-07, -3.576278118089249e-07, -2.3841855067985307e-07, -1.1920928244535389e-07], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "F": -0.7940195798873901, "our": -0.00011431517486926168, "-": -0.010745756328105927, "time": 0.0, "▁cup": -1.8596476365928538e-05, "▁w": -1.9788545614574105e-05, "inners": 0.0, "▁Forest": -0.0005529781919904053, "▁have": -0.8342113494873047, "▁failed": -2.50339189733495e-06, "▁to": 0.0, "▁progress": -1.8715683836489916e-05, "▁past": -4.768370445162873e-07, "▁the": -5.602820692729438e-06, "▁third": 0.0, "▁round": 0.0, "▁for": -1.1920922133867862e-06, "▁": -0.5392757654190063, "1": 0.0, "▁seasons": 0.0, "▁and": -0.0003110878460574895, "▁start": -0.00010513706365600228, "▁their": 0.0, "▁campaign": -1.6927575416048057e-05, "▁at": -8.583032467868179e-06, "▁Don": 0.0, "c": 0.0, "aster": 0.0, "▁on": -8.583032467868179e-06, "▁T": 0.0, "ues": 0.0, "day": 0.0, ".": -0.035087160766124725}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

The process had proved difficult to study, because natural slabs of sandstone erode over millions of years. The key to the experiments, published in Nature Geoscience, was an unusual \"locked sand\" dug from a Czech quarry. The study's first author, Dr Jiri Bruthans from Charles University in Prague, said the results revealed the \"Michelangelo\" behind some of the world's most famous rocky landmarks. \"The stress field is the master sculptor - it tells the weather where to pick,\" he told BBC News. Erosion by wind and water, it seems, is merely the sharp instrument. The remarkable shapes are controlled by internal stresses and strains within the rock, applied by the pull of gravity. As well as showing they could predict the shapes with mathematical models of that stress field, Dr Bruthans and his team sandwiched small cubes of sand under various weights and submerged them in water. The sides of the cube started to fall away within minutes, leaving fewer and fewer grains of sand to bear the weight. As that process continued, eventually the pressure on the remaining column caused the grains to lock together and resist further erosion. When they added faults or other distortions to the cube, and shifted the direction of the pressure applied, the scientists were able to reproduce a gallery of the sort of shapes seen in natural sandstone landforms. They were only able to watch all this happen because of the strange, sticky quality of the sand they used. From the Strelec Quarry, in the north of the Czech Republic, the team collected samples of a sand with particular interlocking properties: \"Strelec locked sand\". It is so soft that for many years it was mined in the quarry using hoses - but when it dried out, explosives had to be used. For his experiments, Dr Bruthans used 10cm blocks of this locked sand that were dried out an oven. \"It was very clever to find this rock out of a quarry that would behave in an accelerated way, compared to those famous sandstone arches,\" commented Dr Simon Mudd, a lecturer in landscape dynamics at the University of Edinburgh, UK. \"They've really demonstrated convincingly that as you erode this material, it begins to concentrate stress,\" he told the BBC. To show that the principle also applies to regular sandstone, Dr Bruthans and his team also took small cubes of normal, \"cemented\" sandstone from the same quarry and attacked them with cycles of heat, cold and salt, to simulate natural erosion. In all cases, Dr Bruthans showed that it was pressure that determined the shapes left behind. \"You can control it completely,\" he said. \"You select the pillar direction, by choosing the points where you apply the compression.\" One experiment even showed that a block of the Strelec sand, placed straddling a small gap and left outside in the rain for 15 months, would naturally form an arch.

But on Monday, DUP leader Arlene Foster said she had not been consulted over it and it appeared it would not go ahead. But Mr McGuinness has said he does not think \"anybody should have a veto on a good idea\". The Irish government government said it proposed the forum to enable groups to work on areas of mutual interest, such as trade, investment and health. The UK's decision to leave the EU dominated a meeting of the North South Ministerial Council on Monday attended by Arlene Foster and Martin McGuinness. Mrs Foster said the forum was not on the agenda. Instead, she said existing cross-border bodies would be used to work out the implications on the island of Ireland of a UK withdrawal from the EU. On Tuesday, Mr McGuinness said indications from \"very senior civil servants within the [Irish] government\" were that Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Enda Kenny would go ahead with the plan. \"I spoke to the taoiseach before the meeting of the North South Ministerial Council - he wasn't putting it as an item on the agenda but he stated very clearly to me that he still believed that it would be a very useful thing to do,\" he said. \"I wouldn't be too exercised about the fact that there will be political elements who wouldn't be interested in attending. \"The DUP will undoubtedly through different methodologies have their say in relation to all of it.\" He said he believed the idea of a forum would \"get widespread support from most within the political process\". Government ministers from Northern Ireland and the Republic drew up a list on Monday of priority areas they intend to work on to limit any potential damage of Brexit. Among the points was an agreement to conduct a \"full audit\" to \"identify the possible impacts, risks, opportunities and contingencies\" that the island could face. And the two finance ministers will \"consider the issue of securing\" further funding for regional development from the EU.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nThe Irish government has proposed a forum to discuss the implications of Brexit on the island of Ireland, but the DUP leader has said she has not been consulted over it and it appears it will not go ahead .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "The", "▁Irish", "▁government", "▁has", "▁proposed", "▁a", "▁forum", "▁to", "▁discuss", "▁the", "▁imp", "lications", "▁of", "▁Bre", "x", "it", "▁on", "▁the", "▁island", "▁of", "▁Ireland", ",", "▁but", "▁the", "▁D", "UP", "▁leader", "▁has", "▁said", "▁she", "▁has", "▁not", "▁been", "▁consult", "ed", "▁over", "▁it", "▁and", "▁it", "▁appears", "▁it", "▁will", "▁not", "▁go", "▁ahead", "▁.", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.04060129076242447, -0.08354334533214569, -0.0019290901254862547, -0.4485284686088562, -0.0673324316740036, -0.36151066422462463, -0.018596231937408447, -0.04182635620236397, -0.046723734587430954, -0.009124130941927433, -0.025698209181427956, 0.0, -8.892617915989831e-05, -0.016650402918457985, 0.0, 0.0, -0.11500855535268784, -0.05454225093126297, -2.6225699912174605e-05, 0.0, 0.0, -0.20270095765590668, -0.008037958294153214, -0.0013442536583170295, -0.021108616143465042, 0.0, -0.5359732508659363, -0.5249910950660706, -0.041387706995010376, -0.00046790618216618896, -0.3995899260044098, -5.364403477869928e-06, 0.0, -4.577531944960356e-05, 0.0, -0.38644877076148987, -0.2519545257091522, -0.16811583936214447, -0.016160568222403526, -0.026660801842808723, -0.00012373158824630082, -0.0029240967705845833, 0.0, -5.364403477869928e-06, 0.0, -0.07890153676271439, -0.12000305205583572, 0.0, -0.6991605758666992, -9.524368942948058e-05, -0.00038926175329834223, -2.90866428258596e-05, -7.295342220459133e-05, -1.4424220353248529e-05, -6.556489552167477e-06, -3.933898824470816e-06, -1.6689286894688848e-06, -1.0728830375228426e-06, -7.152555099310121e-07, -4.768370445162873e-07, -3.576278118089249e-07, -3.576278118089249e-07, -2.3841855067985307e-07], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": -2.3841855067985307e-07, "The": -0.04060129076242447, "▁Irish": -0.08354334533214569, "▁government": -0.0019290901254862547, "▁has": -0.3995899260044098, "▁proposed": -0.0673324316740036, "▁a": -0.36151066422462463, "▁forum": -0.018596231937408447, "▁to": -0.04182635620236397, "▁discuss": -0.046723734587430954, "▁the": -0.0013442536583170295, "▁imp": -0.025698209181427956, "lications": 0.0, "▁of": 0.0, "▁Bre": -0.016650402918457985, "x": 0.0, "it": 0.0, "▁on": -0.11500855535268784, "▁island": -2.6225699912174605e-05, "▁Ireland": 0.0, ",": -0.20270095765590668, "▁but": -0.008037958294153214, "▁D": -0.021108616143465042, "UP": 0.0, "▁leader": -0.5359732508659363, "▁said": -0.041387706995010376, "▁she": -0.00046790618216618896, "▁not": 0.0, "▁been": 0.0, "▁consult": -4.577531944960356e-05, "ed": 0.0, "▁over": -0.38644877076148987, "▁it": -0.00012373158824630082, "▁and": -0.16811583936214447, "▁appears": -0.026660801842808723, "▁will": -0.0029240967705845833, "▁go": -5.364403477869928e-06, "▁ahead": 0.0, "▁.": -0.07890153676271439}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

But some villagers say the blue lias stone used \"looks like concrete\" and should be replaced. Somerset County Council said it was listening to concerns before making a further decision. It said it would be prepared to replace the blue lias with Brecon grey slabs - which are used elsewhere in Dunster - if acceptable, but added it \"would not be cheap\". The work, on West Street, was part of a £400,000 highways improvement scheme, which also included upgrades to traffic signals and resurfacing work. Councillor Harvey Siggs, who is responsible for highways, said the majority of the work \"had been very successful\". \"However, the choice of paving slabs used in West Street has been the subject of some concern.\" he said. Dunster was part of the Luttrell family estate until 1951, when it was sold. After the sale, Somerset County Council's highways department took responsibility for the roads but not the pavements. It previously said it would only adopt the pavement if a smooth surface was laid. The cobbles had fallen into a state of disrepair and people had been falling and injuring themselves. The Dunster Working Group wanted to re-lay them, but was worried about being sued if anyone fell. The village attracts thousands of visitors a year because of its 1,000-year-old castle and features including the medieval cobbled streets. The Dunster Working group includes representatives from Somerset County Council, the local parish council, the National Trust and the Exmoor National Park Authority.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nA road in a village in Somerset has been replaced with stone paving slabs to stop people with buggies and prams and those in wheelchairs having to use the road.

She said that Sophia was wearing just a nappy and T-shirt when she wandered off. \"The only thing I was thinking was well, hopefully the dog would have kept her warm,\" Ms Cook was quoted as saying. \"If [the dog] wasn't with her, I don't know whether they would have found her.\" The family issued a statement thanking emergency services and promising that Poppy would be \"well fed this evening\".\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\nA pet dog is being credited with keeping a little girl safe after the pair wandered away from their family home and could not be found for hours.\n\n###\nArticle: Dai Young, boss of Premiership leaders Wasps, expects a number of his in-form players to make the cut. \"I'd like to think, the way we've played, we'll have a few in there,\" Young told BBC Sport. \"I know [Jones has] had contact with some of the players on a regular basis - we have got a number in the mix.\" Jones will also name a trimmed down party of approximately 35 for a training camp in Brighton next week. The final squad before the autumn Tests will be named on 26 October, and with injuries to Wasps' James Haskell and Harlequins' Jack Clifford, England currently have a void at open-side flanker. Northampton's Teimana Harrison started there in England's last match - against Australia in Sydney as Jones' men wrapped up a series whitewash - and is set to be named in Friday's squad. But the Wasps' pair of Guy Thompson and Sam Jones have impressed so far this campaign. \"There has been a lot of talk about Guy with his form at the start of the season,\" added Young. \"And everyone knows what a big fan I am of Sam Jones - his work-rate is phenomenal.\" Hooker Tommy Taylor has been \"excellent\" according to Young, while Wasps number eight Nathan Hughes is likely to be involved having qualified on residency in the summer. Scrum-halves Joe Simpson and Dan Robson have also both stood out in partnership with fly-half Danny Cipriani. Meanwhile, Leicester flanker Will Evans has been touted as a possible solution to England's number seven conundrum. Evans starred for the Junior World Championship-winning Under-20s in the summer, and followed that by being named in an England training squad in August. It is understood Evans is set be named in the EPS on Friday, but his director of rugby at the Tigers, Richard Cockerill, says the 19-year-old should not yet be thrust into the international arena. \"Will is not ready to play international rugby,\" Cockerill told BBC Sport. \"The reality is he has started one game for Leicester, and before that he was playing for Ampthill in National One. \"Eddie sees him as a project player and is keen to get the transfer from 20s to the senior group - and his potential is huge. \"He is a great young player, who is going to be very, very good. But at the moment but he is not ready yet [for Test rugby].\" However, Cockerill feels differently about Mike Williams, the Zimbabwe-born Tigers forward, who is a firm part of Jones' plans, and could even make his England debut come November. \"Mike Williams has a little bit more experience,\" Cockerill said of the 24-year-old. \"Given the opportunity he is ready to step up to Test match level today.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nEngland coach Eddie Jones is set to name a 35-man England training party on Friday, with Wasps' Dai Young and Leicester's Richard Cockerill both having players in the mix.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "Eng", "land", "▁coach", "▁Edd", "ie", "▁Jones", "▁is", "▁set", "▁to", "▁name", "▁a", "▁", "3", "5", "-", "man", "▁England", "▁training", "▁party", "▁on", "▁Friday", ",", "▁with", "▁Was", "ps", "'", "▁D", "ai", "▁Young", "▁and", "▁Le", "ic", "ester", "'", "s", "▁Richard", "▁C", "ocker", "ill", "▁both", "▁having", "▁players", "▁in", "▁the", "▁mix", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁The", "▁", "2", "0", "1", "8", "▁FIFA", "▁World", "▁Cup"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.0035403212532401085, 0.0, -0.15551401674747467, -0.00292397802695632, 0.0, 0.0, -0.06738013029098511, -0.07952014356851578, 0.0, -0.004678493831306696, -0.0807565376162529, -0.01468175183981657, -0.000399033073335886, -0.5121591687202454, -0.0001062098381225951, -0.0006573423161171377, -0.5841014981269836, -0.18344828486442566, -0.03638141602277756, -0.6955206990242004, -2.50339189733495e-06, -0.00610747653990984, -0.1269562989473343, -0.3648316264152527, 0.0, -0.4929044544696808, -0.014619371853768826, -1.1920928244535389e-07, 0.0, -0.03220530226826668, -0.020112620666623116, 0.0, 0.0, -1.549708758830093e-05, 0.0, -1.1920922133867862e-06, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.00939448643475771, -0.46415162086486816, -0.05892597511410713, -0.003920133225619793, -0.04446312412619591, -0.019105341285467148, -0.03961215540766716, -0.008631895296275616, 0.0, -0.006836357992142439, 0.0, 0.0, -8.22540732769994e-06, 0.0, 0.0, -0.07731147110462189, -0.07162638753652573, -0.0703292042016983, -0.020753610879182816, -0.0013235389487817883, -0.18147963285446167, -0.632150411605835, 0.0, 0.0], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "Eng": -0.0035403212532401085, "land": 0.0, "▁coach": -0.15551401674747467, "▁Edd": -0.00292397802695632, "ie": 0.0, "▁Jones": 0.0, "▁is": -0.06738013029098511, "▁set": -0.07952014356851578, "▁to": 0.0, "▁name": -0.004678493831306696, "▁a": -0.0807565376162529, "▁": -0.07162638753652573, "3": -0.000399033073335886, "5": -0.5121591687202454, "-": -0.0001062098381225951, "man": -0.0006573423161171377, "▁England": -0.5841014981269836, "▁training": -0.18344828486442566, "▁party": -0.03638141602277756, "▁on": -0.6955206990242004, "▁Friday": -2.50339189733495e-06, ",": -0.00610747653990984, "▁with": -0.1269562989473343, "▁Was": -0.3648316264152527, "ps": 0.0, "'": -1.549708758830093e-05, "▁D": -0.014619371853768826, "ai": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "▁Young": 0.0, "▁and": -0.03220530226826668, "▁Le": -0.020112620666623116, "ic": 0.0, "ester": 0.0, "s": 0.0, "▁Richard": -1.1920922133867862e-06, "▁C": 0.0, "ocker": 0.0, "ill": 0.0, "▁both": -0.00939448643475771, "▁having": -0.46415162086486816, "▁players": -0.05892597511410713, "▁in": -0.003920133225619793, "▁the": -0.04446312412619591, "▁mix": -0.019105341285467148, ".": -0.03961215540766716, "##": -0.006836357992142439, "#": 0.0, "Art": -8.22540732769994e-06, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "▁The": -0.07731147110462189, "2": -0.0703292042016983, "0": -0.020753610879182816, "1": -0.0013235389487817883, "8": -0.18147963285446167, "▁FIFA": -0.632150411605835, "▁World": 0.0, "▁Cup": 0.0}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

The nation's 1.4 million active-duty uniformed military personnel remain on duty. However, about half of the defence department's 800,000 civilian employees stopped work at the beginning of the shutdown - with the exception of those engaged in activities that \"provide for the national security\". But on 5 October, the department said it would recall nearly all of these workers. Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel said the decision was based on an interpretation of the Pay Our Military Act, which was passed by Congress shortly before the shutdown. It permits employees \"whose responsibilities contribute to the morale, well-being, capabilities and readiness of service members\" to be exempted from the shutdown. \"I expect us to be able to significantly reduce - but not eliminate - civilian furloughs under this process,\" Mr Hagel said. (only if shutdown continues) The Department of Energy has said it can continue to operate for a short time without sending workers home. However, if the shutdown continues, plans are in place. According to the plans, some facilities will have to close, with only 1,113 out of 13,814 staff required to work. Exemptions include staff overseeing the safety of the nation's nuclear arsenal and operating dams and power lines across the country. The National Nuclear Security Administration, which oversees the nation's nuclear weapons and naval reactor programmes, will have 343 employees on duty to \"perform functions related to the safety of human life and the protection of property\". More than 400 employees will stay on to work at the Southwestern Power Administration and the Western Area Power Administration, which are in charge of overseeing hydroelectric power and power lines in the south and western US. Some staff in other areas will remain at work to oversee \"the protection of human life and property.\" Most of the department's staff have been sent home. However, staff at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration continue to report for duty to ensure weather, shipping and other reports are still provided for public safety. Some of the workers at the Bureau of Industry and Security, which reviews exports, also remain on duty. Transport roles run by the department, ranging from air traffic control to airport and hazardous materials inspections, continue and 36,987 out of 55,468 personnel remain at work. Staff involved in overseeing commercial space launches also continue operations. Suspended activities will include facility security inspections, routine personnel security background investigations and the employee drug testing program. The National Zoo and 19 museums and galleries, including the Natural History Museum, the Portrait Gallery and the Air and Space Museum, are closed. Of the 4,202 employees, 688 are being retained to \"protect life and property\" - security guards, maintenance staff and people to care for and feed the animals at the National Zoo. The Smithsonian Institution says: \"During a shutdown, the Institution cannot legally accept voluntary services from federal employees to continue their regular duties.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nThe US government shutdown has left more than 700,000 employees on unpaid leave since 1 October and closed national parks, tourist sites, government websites, office buildings, and more.

Campaigning group Journalists for Democracy in Sri Lanka says they are proof the boy was summarily executed. A military spokesman denied the allegations. He said they were based on \"lies, half-truths and rumours\". JDS says analysis of the photographs' metadata shows they were taken by the same camera at 10:14 and 12:01 on 19 May 2009 - on the final day of Sri Lankan forces' bitter 26-year war against the Tigers. Velupillai Prabhakaran died at around the same time in a stretch of land between the Nanthikadal lagoon and the sea, where hundreds of thousands of civilians were trapped in the last bloody months of the conflict. The army said he was killed in battle but human rights groups said he might have been killed after surrendering. British film-maker Callum Macrae says the photographs of Balachandran Prabhakaran - which show the young boy first alert and unharmed and in the custody of soldiers but then dead, shot five times in the chest - rules out the government's assertion that Balachandran was killed in crossfire. \"His death was deliberate and calculated. This is a proof, beyond reasonable doubt, of the execution of a child - not a battlefield death,\" said Mr Macrae. \"The pictures fill in chilling details on the circumstances of his murder - and leave the Sri Lankan government with yet more questions to answer.\" But army spokesman Ruwan Wanigasuriya said the photos showed \"no substantive evidence\", and were being released in Mr Macrae's latest documentary, No Fire Zone (NFZ), that is timed to coincide with a session of the UN Human Rights Council next month. In the past two years, Mr Macrae has made films for the British TV station, Channel 4, using video evidence to allege that the government side committed serious war crimes as it defeated the Tamil Tiger militants in 2009 - allegations always denied by Colombo. The new film is set to be screened at the Geneva Human Rights Film Festival during a UN Human Rights Council meeting next month. Meanwhile 133 Sri Lankan Christian clergy, mostly from the former war zone, have signed a letter urging the UN Human Rights Council to pass a strong resolution that is critical of Colombo and will set up an international inquiry into all alleged war crimes. The mainly Tamil churchmen and women say that today the ethnic minority's culture, religions, language and land are being suppressed with what they say is \"an intent to destroy us in whole or part\".\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nA new documentary film alleges that the Sri Lankan government executed a 12-year-old boy in the final days of the country's civil war in 2009, and that the government has failed to investigate the allegations.  \n\n[INST] 2 ", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "A", "▁new", "▁document", "ary", "▁film", "▁alleg", "es", "▁that", "▁the", "▁Sri", "▁L", "ank", "an", "▁government", "▁executed", "▁a", "▁", "1", "2", "-", "year", "-", "old", "▁boy", "▁in", "▁the", "▁final", "▁days", "▁of", "▁the", "▁country", "'", "s", "▁civil", "▁war", "▁in", "▁", "2", "0", "0", "9", ",", "▁and", "▁that", "▁the", "▁government", "▁has", "▁failed", "▁to", "▁investigate", "▁the", "▁alleg", "ations", ".", "▁▁", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "[", "INST", "]", "▁", "2", "▁/"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.04235520586371422, -0.9316458702087402, -0.035077378153800964, 0.0, -0.503824770450592, -0.17979784309864044, -2.622600959512056e-06, -0.016719456762075424, -0.03073778748512268, -0.005929854232817888, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.38546091318130493, -0.0036786997225135565, -0.0017460829112678766, -0.5460528135299683, 0.0, -5.722029527532868e-06, -0.0028109345585107803, 0.0, -3.2782016205601394e-05, 0.0, -0.004490530118346214, -0.8286641240119934, -0.11772327125072479, -0.0034806879702955484, -0.014879319816827774, 0.0, -0.049982182681560516, -0.13874471187591553, 0.0, 0.0, -0.05503135919570923, 0.0, -0.3754216432571411, -1.0728830375228426e-06, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.202633798122406, -0.3877459466457367, -0.061504196375608444, -0.003796157892793417, -0.7610379457473755, -0.3690432012081146, -0.3529510796070099, -2.3841855067985307e-07, -0.04542013257741928, -0.015123466029763222, -0.04025015980005264, -1.0986123085021973, -0.037045951932668686, -0.5313308238983154, 0.0, 0.0, -0.17621996998786926, 0.0, 0.0, -0.519932746887207, -0.17438091337680817, 0.0], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "A": -0.04235520586371422, "▁new": -0.9316458702087402, "▁document": -0.035077378153800964, "ary": 0.0, "▁film": -0.503824770450592, "▁alleg": -0.04025015980005264, "es": -2.622600959512056e-06, "▁that": -0.061504196375608444, "▁the": -0.015123466029763222, "▁Sri": -0.005929854232817888, "▁L": 0.0, "ank": 0.0, "an": 0.0, "▁government": -0.7610379457473755, "▁executed": -0.0036786997225135565, "▁a": -0.0017460829112678766, "▁": -0.519932746887207, "1": 0.0, "2": -0.17438091337680817, "-": -3.2782016205601394e-05, "year": 0.0, "old": 0.0, "▁boy": -0.004490530118346214, "▁in": -0.3754216432571411, "▁final": -0.0034806879702955484, "▁days": -0.014879319816827774, "▁of": 0.0, "▁country": -0.13874471187591553, "'": 0.0, "s": 0.0, "▁civil": -0.05503135919570923, "▁war": 0.0, "0": 0.0, "9": 0.0, ",": -0.202633798122406, "▁and": -0.3877459466457367, "▁has": -0.3690432012081146, "▁failed": -0.3529510796070099, "▁to": -2.3841855067985307e-07, "▁investigate": -0.04542013257741928, "ations": -1.0986123085021973, ".": -0.037045951932668686, "▁▁": -0.5313308238983154, "[": -0.17621996998786926, "INST": 0.0, "]": 0.0, "▁/": 0.0}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

It means virtually all of their profits are being handed over to councils, with some energy schemes now making a loss, BBC Wales has heard. The Welsh Government said it was aware and considering the case for specific assistance. The British Hydropower Association accused ministers of \"sitting on their hands\" while Community Energy Wales said it was \"ripping the guts\" out of projects. Community energy schemes are often small enterprises run by volunteers, designed to generate income for their area. But the way business rates are calculated means hydro schemes are hit hard: Business rates in England and Wales are calculated by an independent body - the Valuation Office Agency - but the Welsh Government is in charge of how they are raised here. The British Hydropower Association has written to Finance Secretary Mark Drakeford to ask for support. Chief executive Simon Hamlyn said: \"Community hydro schemes are suffering and those businesses will say we can't afford to pay these rates and they'll abandon these schemes and that's the last thing we want.\" Keith Jones, director of Community Energy Wales, said the average increase was 300%. \"No-one could foresee this coming, we didn't even put it down as a risk in our business plans that such a blunt instrument would be used to get more money out of us.\" Mr Jones said the Scottish government had extended a 100% business rates relief for community energy schemes while in England they were capping the increase at £600. Gavin Gatehouse helps run the Ynni Anafon hydro scheme in Abergwyngregyn, Gwynedd, which has seen its monthly rate rise from about £900 to more than £2,000. It took five years to set up and could generate up to £40,000 of disposable income per year for projects in the area. A charity has been formed so groups and individuals can apply for grants, but this increase means there will be less money to hand out. The community hydro at Bethesda is predicting it will now make a loss. \"It's very frustrating and I'm very angry about it,\" Mr Gatehouse said. \"We'll be seeing a huge proportion of our profit eaten away to substitute for lack of government provision of grants to local authorities.\" Mr Drakeford has said more than £210m of rate relief was being provided for 2017-18 to businesses including community energy projects. \"We are going to prepare a new scheme for rate relief for small business from 2018 onwards. I am happy, as part of this, to consider the case for specific assistance and support for some projects, including the community energy projects and community hydro projects.\" The Green Party said it would remove subsidies to fossil fuels and scrap \"regressive taxes\" on the community energy sector. Welsh Liberal Democrats pledged to review business rates exemptions and make a presumption in favour of renewable energy projects \"in or on suitable publicly owned buildings and land\". Plaid Cymru's shadow cabinet secretary for energy, Simon Thomas, said\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nCommunity energy schemes in Wales are facing huge increases in business rates, with some making a loss.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "Comm", "unity", "▁energy", "▁schemes", "▁in", "▁Wales", "▁are", "▁facing", "▁huge", "▁increases", "▁in", "▁business", "▁rates", ",", "▁with", "▁some", "▁making", "▁a", "▁loss", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁The", "▁government", "▁has", "▁been", "▁ur", "ged", "▁to", "▁investigate", "▁the", "▁impact", "▁of", "▁the", "▁new", "▁tax", "▁on", "▁the", "▁sector", ",", "▁which", "▁is", "▁already", "▁facing", "▁a", "▁number", "▁of", "▁challeng", "es", "▁including", "▁a", "▁lack", "▁of", "▁invest", "ment", "▁and", "▁a"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.014985253103077412, -3.6954811548639555e-06, -0.02326524630188942, -0.02448880858719349, -0.023454489186406136, 0.0, -0.015601838007569313, -0.3650135397911072, -0.25931185483932495, -0.5204319953918457, -3.576278118089249e-07, -0.010243108496069908, -7.152555099310121e-07, -0.07262007147073746, -0.2560703754425049, -0.0013699679402634501, -0.022688914090394974, -0.00016735584358684719, -1.6689286894688848e-06, -0.29557004570961, -0.006739859934896231, 0.0, -5.602820692729438e-06, 0.0, 0.0, -2.3841855067985307e-07, 0.0, 0.0, -0.056838780641555786, -1.0775971412658691, -0.5297814011573792, -0.6639643907546997, -0.5319299101829529, 0.0, -1.3351351299206726e-05, -0.5996443033218384, -0.18706360459327698, -0.2459266185760498, -0.0029448973946273327, -0.370224267244339, -0.104653500020504, -0.5675424337387085, -0.0006541258189827204, -0.006948829162865877, -0.8256829380989075, -0.20773237943649292, -0.020056655630469322, -0.6301760673522949, -0.3335426151752472, -0.5259374976158142, -0.4831574559211731, -0.5881873369216919, 0.0, -0.00673524197191, 0.0, -0.5305092334747314, -1.0015904903411865, -0.00021252757869660854, 0.0, -0.39594846963882446, -1.7881377516459906e-06, -0.04252030327916145, -0.12850536406040192], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "Comm": -0.014985253103077412, "unity": -3.6954811548639555e-06, "▁energy": -0.02326524630188942, "▁schemes": -0.02448880858719349, "▁in": -3.576278118089249e-07, "▁Wales": 0.0, "▁are": -0.015601838007569313, "▁facing": -0.5259374976158142, "▁huge": -0.25931185483932495, "▁increases": -0.5204319953918457, "▁business": -0.010243108496069908, "▁rates": -7.152555099310121e-07, ",": -0.20773237943649292, "▁with": -0.2560703754425049, "▁some": -0.0013699679402634501, "▁making": -0.022688914090394974, "▁a": -0.12850536406040192, "▁loss": -1.6689286894688848e-06, ".": -0.29557004570961, "##": -5.602820692729438e-06, "#": 0.0, "Art": -2.3841855067985307e-07, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "▁The": -0.056838780641555786, "▁government": -1.0775971412658691, "▁has": -0.5297814011573792, "▁been": -0.6639643907546997, "▁ur": -0.5319299101829529, "ged": 0.0, "▁to": -1.3351351299206726e-05, "▁investigate": -0.5996443033218384, "▁the": -0.006948829162865877, "▁impact": -0.2459266185760498, "▁of": 0.0, "▁new": -0.104653500020504, "▁tax": -0.5675424337387085, "▁on": -0.0006541258189827204, "▁sector": -0.8256829380989075, "▁which": -0.020056655630469322, "▁is": -0.6301760673522949, "▁already": -0.3335426151752472, "▁number": -0.5881873369216919, "▁challeng": -0.00673524197191, "es": 0.0, "▁including": -0.5305092334747314, "▁lack": -0.00021252757869660854, "▁invest": -0.39594846963882446, "ment": -1.7881377516459906e-06, "▁and": -0.04252030327916145}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

O'Sullivan won seven frames in a row to move 8-4 ahead before Perry, helped by breaks of 117 and 92, fought back. But O'Sullivan, 41, sealed victory to defend his title and move ahead of Stephen Hendry's six Masters wins. Victory means O'Sullivan claimed the newly named Paul Hunter trophy - in honour of the three-time champion who died of cancer aged 27 in 2006 - as well as the £200,000 winners' prize money. It also ensured the world number 13 ended a run of three defeats in finals this season and defended the title he won last year by thrashing Barry Hawkins 10-1. \"Joe played a brilliant tournament, a really good match and he should've beaten me. I got lucky - I stole it,\" said O'Sullivan. \"Joe will come again and he is a tough competitor. I'm just relieved to have got over the line. The fans have been unbelievable and I really enjoyed this week.\" On winning seven Masters title, O'Sullivan added: \"It is great to get some records, I still have the World Championship one to get. \"When I was younger I was just happy to win one, so to win seven, someone up there is looking after me.\" 'The Rocket' had to deal with a virus in his first-round final-frame victory over Liang Wenbo and needed to repair a broken cue tip in the semi-final against Marco Fu, which he said was the \"best match he has ever won\". In the final, O'Sullivan seemed unsettled by noise coming from a backstage table early on, but pulled himself together to level the match 4-4 at the interval. He claimed a 32-minute ninth frame to move into the lead for the first time, and then knocked in breaks of 85 and 68 to take control. At 8-6 and with Perry fighting back, O'Sullivan made his first century of the match - a break of 112 - and 859th of his career. The Englishman then held his nerve to win a 20-minute tactical frame and claim his 17th Triple Crown title. Along with seven Masters - the first of which he won in 1995 - he has also claimed five World and five UK Championship crowns, and is now just one behind Hendry's record of 18.

The police said that a post-mortem examination showed he died as a \"direct result of the injuries\" of the bomb. A dissident republican group, widely referred to as the new IRA, said it carried out the attack. The organisation said Mr Ismay was targeted for training officers at Maghaberry Prison near Lisburn, County Antrim. Sue McAllister, director general of the Northern Ireland Prison Service, spent time with the Ismay family on Wednesday. She said they were \"devastated and beyond shock at what's happened\". \"Like all of us, they thought that he was on the mend and was doing really well,\" said Mrs McAllister. \"We thought he would make a full recovery, we expected him to come back to work in due course, so we're all shocked, but particularly Sharon and her daughters.\" Mrs McAllister condemned the behaviour of some paramilitary inmates at Maghaberry Prison, who reportedly cheered, smoked cigars and mocked wardens at the high-security jail when news of Mr Ismay's death filtered through. \"This was just unacceptable behaviour by a very small number of prisoners,\" said Mrs McAllister. \"My colleagues in Maghaberry dealt with it professionally, with great fortitude and with the courage they display on a daily basis.\" She admitted she and her colleagues in the Prison Service felt \"very angry\" on hearing the reports of the celebrations in the exercise yard of the prison. \"We encounter challenging behaviour by a small number of prisoners every day, and we deal with it with great professionalism and we do not stoop to behaving that way in response,\" she added. A man appeared in court on Saturday charged in connection with the bomb attack on Mr Ismay. Det Ch Insp Richard Campbell said it was \"yet another difficult day for the Ismay family, his friends and colleagues as they struggle to come to terms with the events of the past 12 days\". He added: \"We have spoken to the family this morning and advised them of this development. \"We are also liaising with the Public Prosecution Service in relation to the individual who is currently charged with attempted murder and causing an explosion with intent to endanger life.\" The PSNI have also repeated an appeal for information on two cars that police believe may have been used by the bombers - a red Citroen C3 and a silver Skoda Fabia.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nA man has been charged with murdering a prison officer in a booby trap bomb attack in Northern Ireland .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "A", "▁man", "▁has", "▁been", "▁charged", "▁with", "▁murder", "ing", "▁a", "▁prison", "▁officer", "▁in", "▁a", "▁bo", "oby", "▁trap", "▁bomb", "▁attack", "▁in", "▁Northern", "▁Ireland", "▁.", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.0007246490567922592, -0.6526384353637695, -0.07655347883701324, -0.002086725551635027, -0.0005534547381103039, -0.17347851395606995, -0.21598652005195618, -0.4714496433734894, -0.00013553177996072918, -0.010297974571585655, -0.0006049233488738537, -0.1732282191514969, -0.05392550304532051, -0.20871500670909882, 0.0, -0.2519296109676361, -0.022793440148234367, -0.004492784850299358, -0.36282289028167725, -0.0019320646533742547, 0.0, -0.002000237349420786, -0.010760616511106491, 0.0, -0.01894954778254032, -0.0004109491710551083, -0.0010449193650856614, -0.0006338732782751322, -0.0009662011871114373, -1.3708974620385561e-05, -8.940656698541716e-06, -2.50339189733495e-06, -1.6689286894688848e-06, -1.0728830375228426e-06, -7.152555099310121e-07, -1.0728830375228426e-06, -7.152555099310121e-07, -3.576278118089249e-07, -3.576278118089249e-07, -2.3841855067985307e-07, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -1.1920928244535389e-07, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "A": -0.0007246490567922592, "▁man": -0.6526384353637695, "▁has": -0.07655347883701324, "▁been": -0.002086725551635027, "▁charged": -0.0005534547381103039, "▁with": -0.17347851395606995, "▁murder": -0.21598652005195618, "ing": -0.4714496433734894, "▁a": -0.05392550304532051, "▁prison": -0.010297974571585655, "▁officer": -0.0006049233488738537, "▁in": -0.36282289028167725, "▁bo": -0.20871500670909882, "oby": 0.0, "▁trap": -0.2519296109676361, "▁bomb": -0.022793440148234367, "▁attack": -0.004492784850299358, "▁Northern": -0.0019320646533742547, "▁Ireland": 0.0, "▁.": -0.002000237349420786}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

The Fire Department of New York earlier told the BBC the two people were uninjured and tethered. The call came in at 12:42 EST (17:42 GMT) and firefighters were on the scene in less than four minutes, it said. The window cleaners were pulled inside at around 14:15 EST. The rescued men were identified as Juan Lopez, who has been a window cleaner for five years, and Juan Lizama, who has been on the job for 14 years, Gerard McEneaney, a labour union official, told Reuters. The 1,776ft (541m) tower opened for business last week as the first of 3,000 employees of publishing giant Conde Nast moved into their new offices there. A police official said the partially collapsed cradle was hanging at \"a 75-degree angle\". The cable on the cradle apparently broke as it retracted towards the roof of the building.

He initially denied four charges but later admitted transporting the images. Under a plea agreement he is expected to be sentenced to 13 years in January. He was jailed for 56 months in the UK in 2011 for possessing indecent images of children. More on this and other news from Cambridgeshire Wilkins, who holds dual UK and US citizenship, was on probation when he left the UK on 31 January. He set up an online site enabling him to arrange to meet boys, but was caught in a sting operation in Palm Springs, California, by undercover Homeland Security Department special agents. He had paid one agent $250 (Â£170) to have sex with a nine-year-old Mexican boy. Wilkins had initially denied four charges of travelling with the intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct, attempted sex trafficking of children, transportation of child pornography and possession of child pornography, the US District Attorney's Office said. A trial date was set for November, however, at a hearing on Wednesday he pleaded guilty to transporting child pornography under a plea agreement with the US Attorney's Office. He agreed to a 13-year prison term and a lifetime of supervised release, the US Department of Homeland Security said. Wilkins also admitted in court to travelling to the US in order to have sex with two young brothers, paying to have sex with the nine-year-old, possessing pornography and bringing a computer into the US containing \"graphic images of boys ranging in age from five to eight\". US Attorney Eileen Decker, chief federal law enforcement officer in the Central District of California, described Wilkins as a \"predator\" and \"extremely dangerous\". The plea agreement meant he would \"be in prison for well over a decade,\" she said. As part of the agreement the three other counts are expected to be dismissed when Wilkins is sentenced for the transportation charge. Wilkins was detained as part of Homeland Security's Operation Predator, an international initiative to protect children from sexual predators.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nA man who travelled to California to have sex with boys aged 10 and 12 has been jailed in the US.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "A", "▁man", "▁who", "▁travel", "led", "▁to", "▁California", "▁to", "▁have", "▁sex", "▁with", "▁boys", "▁aged", "▁", "1", "0", "▁and", "▁", "1", "2", "▁has", "▁been", "▁ja", "iled", "▁in", "▁the", "▁US", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁A", "▁", "2", "1", "-", "year", "-", "old", "▁man", "▁has", "▁been", "▁arrested", "▁on", "▁susp", "icion", "▁of", "▁murder", "ing", "▁his", "▁", "1", "6", "-", "year", "-", "old", "▁girl"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -6.997340824455023e-05, -0.39374083280563354, -0.629177987575531, -0.1305859237909317, -2.3841855067985307e-07, -0.00292397802695632, -0.11736269295215607, -0.0004326361231505871, -0.12533162534236908, -8.583032467868179e-06, 0.0, -0.6690506935119629, -0.009025372564792633, -3.2186455882765586e-06, 0.0, -2.3841855067985307e-07, -1.5497195136049413e-06, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.004223475232720375, -0.7389997839927673, -0.0002653246629051864, 0.0, -0.023606322705745697, -2.3841830625315197e-06, -0.0005727558163926005, -0.36326518654823303, -0.001392229343764484, 0.0, -0.011429193429648876, 0.0, 0.0, -1.1920928244535389e-07, 0.0, 0.0, -0.3052350878715515, -0.5511945486068726, -0.5562704801559448, -1.1814074516296387, -0.0003719830128829926, -1.0728830375228426e-06, -1.7881377516459906e-06, 0.0, -0.029323453083634377, -0.25496751070022583, -0.0005666795768775046, -0.544762909412384, -0.625909149646759, -1.7881377516459906e-06, 0.0, 0.0, -0.008584147319197655, -0.26314207911491394, -0.2532653510570526, -1.0095528364181519, -0.037311967462301254, -0.9560773968696594, -2.3841855067985307e-07, -0.004432021174579859, -4.768370445162873e-07, 0.0, -0.16562733054161072], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "A": -6.997340824455023e-05, "▁man": -0.029323453083634377, "▁who": -0.629177987575531, "▁travel": -0.1305859237909317, "led": -2.3841855067985307e-07, "▁to": -0.0004326361231505871, "▁California": -0.11736269295215607, "▁have": -0.12533162534236908, "▁sex": -8.583032467868179e-06, "▁with": 0.0, "▁boys": -0.6690506935119629, "▁aged": -0.009025372564792633, "▁": -1.0095528364181519, "1": -0.037311967462301254, "0": -2.3841855067985307e-07, "▁and": -1.5497195136049413e-06, "2": -0.5562704801559448, "▁has": -0.25496751070022583, "▁been": -0.0005666795768775046, "▁ja": -0.0002653246629051864, "iled": 0.0, "▁in": -0.023606322705745697, "▁the": -2.3841830625315197e-06, "▁US": -0.0005727558163926005, ".": -0.36326518654823303, "##": -0.011429193429648876, "#": 0.0, "Art": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "▁A": -0.3052350878715515, "-": -4.768370445162873e-07, "year": -0.004432021174579859, "old": 0.0, "▁arrested": -0.544762909412384, "▁on": -0.625909149646759, "▁susp": -1.7881377516459906e-06, "icion": 0.0, "▁of": 0.0, "▁murder": -0.008584147319197655, "ing": -0.26314207911491394, "▁his": -0.2532653510570526, "6": -0.9560773968696594, "▁girl": -0.16562733054161072}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

NHS 24 chief executive Ian Crichton warned that keeping the Future Programme in service at this level of operation would be unsafe for patients. He said he expected the volume of calls the helpline receives over the weekend to \"significantly increase\" as winter approaches, which indicates that the service \"would fall below acceptable tolerances\". \"This is not a decision that we have taken lightly, given the significant investment to date, but one that will ensure we can continue to deliver vital and safe out-of-hours support to patients when they need it most during the coming winter\", he said. The NHS will continue to develop the new system offline before rolling it out again early in the new year. Scottish Labour's public services spokeswoman Jackie Baillie accused the Scottish government of having a \"short-term, sticking plaster approach to the NHS\". Scottish Conservative health spokesman Jackson Carlaw called the project \"a mismanaged shambles\" which had cost the taxpayer a fortune. Health Secretary Shona Robison said that while NHS 24 remained fully operational, she was disappointed that it had to revert to the previous system. However, she said patient safety was the priority and \"it is right that NHS 24 take the time necessary to understand and fix any outstanding problems completely\". Theresa Fyffe, Royal College of Nursing Scotland director, said it was \"regrettable\" but \"the right decision\" for patients and staff. The announcement follows an incident in October, when the same system crashed and staff had to resort to pen and paper. An Audit Scotland report had also previously raised concerns over the cost and delivery of the system. Initially due to be ready for October 2013, it was delayed for two years and cost about £117m - almost £40m above the expected cost.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nThe NHS 24 helpline has been forced to revert to its old system after just 10 days because of problems with a new computer system.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "The", "▁N", "HS", "▁", "2", "4", "▁hel", "pl", "ine", "▁has", "▁been", "▁forced", "▁to", "▁revert", "▁to", "▁its", "▁old", "▁system", "▁after", "▁just", "▁", "1", "0", "▁days", "▁because", "▁of", "▁problems", "▁with", "▁a", "▁new", "▁computer", "▁system", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁A", "▁", "1", "2", "-", "year", "-", "old", "▁boy", "▁has", "▁been", "▁charged", "▁with", "▁the", "▁murder", "▁of", "▁a", "▁", "1", "6", "-", "year"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.6617430448532104, -0.2520235478878021, 0.0, -0.25611579418182373, -8.583032467868179e-06, 0.0, -0.006286252290010452, 0.0, 0.0, -0.14163951575756073, -0.5390924215316772, -0.0012236495967954397, -2.3841855067985307e-07, -0.012508394196629524, -0.00036459474358707666, -0.07477208226919174, -0.11737191677093506, -9.941560711013153e-05, -0.07011506706476212, -0.02524080127477646, -0.00038890427094884217, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.3251231014728546, -3.4689302992774174e-05, -0.5206278562545776, -1.07287787614041e-05, -0.3655843138694763, -1.0728830375228426e-06, -0.2430732101202011, -5.4238757002167404e-05, -0.187003493309021, -0.005339527502655983, 0.0, -0.0006119524477981031, 0.0, 0.0, -1.9073468138230965e-06, 0.0, 0.0, -0.07273291796445847, -0.6017341017723083, -0.556540846824646, -1.3409349918365479, -0.11807841807603836, -1.1920922133867862e-06, -7.056941103655845e-05, 0.0, -0.3609277009963989, -0.4985377788543701, -0.1175910085439682, -0.21054255962371826, -0.0029384789522737265, -0.1274537444114685, -9.381330892210826e-05, -2.3841855067985307e-07, -0.2563205361366272, -0.028947610408067703, -0.10434166342020035, -0.4020516574382782, -0.0008388814167119563, 0.0], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "The": -0.6617430448532104, "▁N": -0.2520235478878021, "HS": 0.0, "▁": -0.028947610408067703, "2": -1.3409349918365479, "4": 0.0, "▁hel": -0.006286252290010452, "pl": 0.0, "ine": 0.0, "▁has": -0.4985377788543701, "▁been": -0.1175910085439682, "▁forced": -0.0012236495967954397, "▁to": -0.00036459474358707666, "▁revert": -0.012508394196629524, "▁its": -0.07477208226919174, "▁old": -0.11737191677093506, "▁system": -5.4238757002167404e-05, "▁after": -0.07011506706476212, "▁just": -0.02524080127477646, "1": -0.10434166342020035, "0": 0.0, "▁days": 0.0, "▁because": -0.3251231014728546, "▁of": -2.3841855067985307e-07, "▁problems": -0.5206278562545776, "▁with": -0.0029384789522737265, "▁a": -0.2563205361366272, "▁new": -1.0728830375228426e-06, "▁computer": -0.2430732101202011, ".": -0.187003493309021, "##": -0.0006119524477981031, "#": 0.0, "Art": -1.9073468138230965e-06, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "▁A": -0.07273291796445847, "-": -0.0008388814167119563, "year": 0.0, "old": 0.0, "▁boy": -0.3609277009963989, "▁charged": -0.21054255962371826, "▁the": -0.1274537444114685, "▁murder": -9.381330892210826e-05, "6": -0.4020516574382782}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

But Congress is deeply opposed to terror suspects being held on US soil and is expected to block the move. The prison costs $445m (£316m) to run annually and closing it was a 2009 promise from President Barack Obama. Human rights campaigners have repeatedly complained about the prison in Cuba, which has held 780 detainees since it opened in 2002. The president told reporters on Tuesday it undermined national security. \"This is about closing a chapter in our history,\" said Mr Obama. \"It reflects the lessons we've learned since 9/11 - lessons that must guide our nation going forward.\" But Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio was scathing in his criticism, saying Guantanamo prisoners do not belong on US soil. \"These are literally enemy combatants,\" he said, adding he would ship terrorists straight to Guantanamo \"to find out what they know\". Life after Guantanamo prison Will Guantanamo prison finally close? There are four main components in the White House plan: It estimates the move would save up to $180m (£128m) a year in cost savings. The president, who will complete his second and final term in January, said it was important not to pass the problem on to his successor. \"Keeping this facility open is contrary to our values. It undermines our standing in the world. It is viewed as a stain on our broader record of upholding the highest standards of rule of law.'' President Obama has tried for years to close Guantanamo. He and his deputies say that it hurts the reputation of the US and that militants use \"the infamous orange jumpsuit\", as one senior administration official described it, as a recruiting tool. But members of Congress have baulked at Mr Obama's plan to close the prison, saying they believe it should remain open - and they don't want any detainees to be transferred to the US. Representative Mike Pompeo of Kansas, for example, said the prisoners should \"stay right where they are\". Lately, though, White House officials said that lawmakers, or at least some of them, seem more receptive to the idea. A senior administration official told reporters that there's \"room for conversation\". That's important since Mr Obama has less than a year to close the prison - and for him time is of the essence. Guantanamo Bay is located on an American naval base in south eastern Cuba. Former US President George W Bush opened it to accommodate foreign terror suspects after the 9/11 attacks on the US. One of the key complaints from human rights groups is that many detainees have been held there without charge or trial. White House officials said they could not give any names of people being held, but the New York Times has its own list. The Obama plan does not specify where in the US detainees would go.

She campaigned against Communism and is credited with creating the political climate that helped Ronald Reagan become president. Mrs Schlafly publicly endorsed Donald Trump at a rally in March. Paying tribute to her on Monday, the Republican presidential candidate described Mrs Schlafly as \"a patriot, a champion for women and a symbol of strength\". Mrs Schlafly's death, in St Louis, was announced by the Eagle Forum, a conservative group she founded in 1972. It described her as an \"iconic American leader whose love for America was surpassed only by her love of God and her family\". Mrs Schlafly was a strong advocate of traditional family values and one of her crowning political victories was helping to stop the Equal Rights Amendment [ERA] from being added to the US Constitution. She once described feminists as \"a bunch of bitter women seeking a constitutional cure for their personal problems\". Donald T Critchlow, author of a biography of Phyllis Schlafly, said that defeating the ERA helped to usher in a new conservative era in US politics, paving the way for Ronald Reagan's election in 1980. The Eagle Forum said Mrs Schlafly was survived by her six children, 16 grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nPhyllis Schlafly, a conservative activist who campaigned against feminism and abortion and helped Republicans block the Equal Rights Amendment in the 1970s, has died aged 92.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "Ph", "yll", "is", "▁Sch", "la", "fly", ",", "▁a", "▁conserv", "ative", "▁activ", "ist", "▁who", "▁campaign", "ed", "▁against", "▁femin", "ism", "▁and", "▁abort", "ion", "▁and", "▁helped", "▁Republic", "ans", "▁block", "▁the", "▁Equ", "al", "▁Rights", "▁Am", "end", "ment", "▁in", "▁the", "▁", "1", "9", "7", "0", "s", ",", "▁has", "▁died", "▁aged", "▁", "9", "2", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁The", "▁", "2", "0", "1", "6"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.03047279641032219, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -2.9802276912960224e-06, -0.026923557743430138, -0.02621440216898918, 0.0, -0.06071672961115837, 0.0, -0.023862432688474655, -0.09863439947366714, 0.0, -5.006777428206988e-06, -0.3993412256240845, 0.0, -0.010172544978559017, -0.0007946909172460437, 0.0, -0.035406969487667084, -0.0012880609137937427, -0.001683486276306212, 0.0, -0.0008691347320564091, -1.1920928244535389e-07, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.0029326549265533686, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -1.1920922133867862e-06, -0.0008386432309634984, 0.0, -0.25349944829940796, 0.0, -2.992108420585282e-05, -4.768370445162873e-07, -0.01018245704472065, -0.0005771639989688993, 0.0, -0.2561149597167969, 0.0, 0.0, -2.0265558760002023e-06, 0.0, 0.0, -0.13921485841274261, -0.4588325023651123, -0.7121137976646423, -0.0040556094609200954, -0.0029791281558573246, -0.1750432699918747], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "Ph": -0.03047279641032219, "yll": 0.0, "is": 0.0, "▁Sch": 0.0, "la": 0.0, "fly": 0.0, ",": -1.1920922133867862e-06, "▁a": -0.026923557743430138, "▁conserv": -0.02621440216898918, "ative": 0.0, "▁activ": -0.06071672961115837, "ist": 0.0, "▁who": -0.023862432688474655, "▁campaign": -0.09863439947366714, "ed": 0.0, "▁against": -5.006777428206988e-06, "▁femin": -0.3993412256240845, "ism": 0.0, "▁and": -0.035406969487667084, "▁abort": -0.0007946909172460437, "ion": 0.0, "▁helped": -0.0012880609137937427, "▁Republic": -0.001683486276306212, "ans": 0.0, "▁block": -0.0008691347320564091, "▁the": 0.0, "▁Equ": 0.0, "al": 0.0, "▁Rights": 0.0, "▁Am": 0.0, "end": 0.0, "ment": 0.0, "▁in": -0.0029326549265533686, "▁": -0.4588325023651123, "1": -0.0029791281558573246, "9": -2.992108420585282e-05, "7": 0.0, "0": -0.0040556094609200954, "s": 0.0, "▁has": -0.0008386432309634984, "▁died": 0.0, "▁aged": -0.25349944829940796, "2": -0.7121137976646423, ".": -0.01018245704472065, "##": -0.2561149597167969, "#": 0.0, "Art": -2.0265558760002023e-06, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "▁The": -0.13921485841274261, "6": -0.1750432699918747}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

Sinclair was convicted last year of raping and murdering Christine Eadie and Helen Scott in 1977. The teenagers disappeared after being in the World's End pub in Edinburgh's Royal Mile. Their naked bodies were later found in a field in East Lothian. Police believe Sinclair has also killed at least six other women and girls. The sentence given to Sinclair, who will turn 70 this year, means he would be aged 106 before he was eligible to apply for parole. His conviction brought one of Scotland's most infamous unsolved cases to a conclusion, and marked the first prosecution since changes to Scotland's double jeopardy law. Sinclair, a violent offender who has already spent more than half of his life in prison, had intended to appeal against the World's End conviction. But a procedural hearing at the Appeal Court in Edinburgh was told that he no longer intends to appeal against the conviction, a spokesman for the Judicial Office for Scotland confirmed. A formal abandonment is expected to be lodged in due course and his appeal against sentence will be heard in November.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nA serial rapist and murderer who was jailed for life for the 1977 murders of two teenagers in Edinburgh, Scotland, will not appeal against his conviction.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "A", "▁serial", "▁rap", "ist", "▁and", "▁murder", "er", "▁who", "▁was", "▁ja", "iled", "▁for", "▁life", "▁for", "▁the", "▁", "1", "9", "7", "7", "▁mur", "ders", "▁of", "▁two", "▁te", "en", "agers", "▁in", "▁Edinburgh", ",", "▁Scotland", ",", "▁will", "▁not", "▁appeal", "▁against", "▁his", "▁conv", "iction", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁The", "▁", "4", "5", "-", "year", "-", "old", ",", "▁who", "▁was", "▁born", "▁in", "▁the", "▁Netherlands"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.031105563044548035, -0.6478214859962463, -0.17308355867862701, 0.0, -5.543078441405669e-05, -0.00015841660206206143, 0.0, -0.13181796669960022, -0.1397109180688858, -0.374959796667099, 0.0, -0.0005566716426983476, -0.0026704147458076477, -0.7424681782722473, -0.18040964007377625, -1.0195395946502686, -7.152555099310121e-07, 0.0, -2.3841855067985307e-07, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -0.02538120746612549, 0.0, 0.0, -0.00012718822108581662, -0.02479260414838791, 0.0, -0.3608849048614502, -0.6141417622566223, -0.004437124822288752, -1.0241692066192627, -0.10026901960372925, -0.0002076410164590925, -0.34469467401504517, -0.0023899106308817863, -0.0012722263345494866, -0.0029372903518378735, -0.015395843423902988, -0.0013458014000207186, -1.0728830375228426e-06, -0.17969197034835815, -0.0013156814966350794, 0.0, -5.602820692729438e-06, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.0818709135055542, -0.04319915547966957, -0.44398069381713867, -0.7669094800949097, -0.00015007323236204684, -3.576278118089249e-07, -1.0728830375228426e-06, 0.0, -0.8292991518974304, -0.005899398121982813, -0.2748093008995056, -0.7675735354423523, -0.0045008547604084015, -0.13240449130535126, -0.5500936508178711], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "A": -0.031105563044548035, "▁serial": -0.6478214859962463, "▁rap": -0.17308355867862701, "ist": 0.0, "▁and": -5.543078441405669e-05, "▁murder": -0.00015841660206206143, "er": 0.0, "▁who": -0.005899398121982813, "▁was": -0.2748093008995056, "▁ja": -0.374959796667099, "iled": 0.0, "▁for": -0.7424681782722473, "▁life": -0.0026704147458076477, "▁the": -0.13240449130535126, "▁": -0.04319915547966957, "1": -7.152555099310121e-07, "9": 0.0, "7": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "▁mur": -0.02538120746612549, "ders": 0.0, "▁of": 0.0, "▁two": -0.00012718822108581662, "▁te": -0.02479260414838791, "en": 0.0, "agers": -0.3608849048614502, "▁in": -0.0045008547604084015, "▁Edinburgh": -0.004437124822288752, ",": -0.8292991518974304, "▁Scotland": -0.10026901960372925, "▁will": -0.34469467401504517, "▁not": -0.0023899106308817863, "▁appeal": -0.0012722263345494866, "▁against": -0.0029372903518378735, "▁his": -0.015395843423902988, "▁conv": -0.0013458014000207186, "iction": -1.0728830375228426e-06, ".": -0.17969197034835815, "##": -5.602820692729438e-06, "#": 0.0, "Art": 0.0, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "▁The": -0.0818709135055542, "4": -0.44398069381713867, "5": -0.7669094800949097, "-": -1.0728830375228426e-06, "year": -3.576278118089249e-07, "old": 0.0, "▁born": -0.7675735354423523, "▁Netherlands": -0.5500936508178711}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

However, the council is now paying Â£450 to fill it up again, so that the town looks its best for key 2012 events. It will be working on the 4 and 5 June and when the Olympic torch relay passes through the borough on 8 July. The fountain on Parkway in the town was built to celebrate the Queen's accession to the throne in 1952. It is supplied by an underground tank, but had to be switched off after the water level dropped and could not be refilled. The council is buying water from a landscaping firm which already supplies water from a natural lake source, to maintain the borough's open spaces.

However, a raid into the town launched at dawn is reported to have been repelled by militants. The offensive, which began on Tuesday, is aimed at cutting a key route between IS-controlled areas in Syria and Iraq. The NSA said it was co-ordinating the assault with Iraqi government forces, who were advancing on the border from the other side. Several hundred rebels are reportedly involved in the attack on Albu Kamal, just a few kilometres from the Iraqi border in Deir al-Zour province. The NSA and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, both said on Wednesday morning that the rebels had taken control of Hamdan airport, about 5km (3 miles) north-west of the town. Fighting was continuing between the two sides in agricultural areas around the town, and coalition warplanes were conducting air strikes on IS hideouts in the town, according to the Syrian Observatory. NSA spokesman Mozahem al-Saloum told the Associated Press that airborne fighters had also been dropped onto the southern edge of Albu Kamal. Later on Wednesday, the NSA issued a statement saying its forces had \"conducted a deep penetration raid\" into Albu Kamal. \"At this time fighting is still ongoing, but the NSA maintains control of the desert, the approaches to Albu Kamal, and maintains freedom of manoeuvre,\" it added. The Reuters news agency cited two rebel sources as saying that the NSA had been forced to retreat to the outskirts after an IS counter-attack. One of the sources said militants had encircled the rebels in a surprise ambush. The rebels had incurred heavy casualties and lost some of their weapons, the source added. As the rebels advanced on Albu Kamal, IS released a video showing militants beheading five young men in the town who they claimed were working with the NSA, the Syrian Observatory said. The NSA was formed about 18 months ago by rebel factions driven out of eastern Syria by IS, which proclaimed the creation of a \"caliphate\" in June 2014. NSA fighters, who have been trained at US-run camps in Jordan, captured the Tanf border crossing between Syria and Iraq from IS earlier this year. IS is also facing pressure from a US-backed offensive in northern Syria by an alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters, who have surrounded the town of Manbij and cut a route to the Turkish border from the IS stronghold of Raqqa. In a separate development on Wednesday, at least seven people were killed in a car bomb attack in the Kurdish-controlled northern town of Tal Abyad, near the Turkish border, state media reported.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nA rebel alliance is fighting to cut a key route between IS-controlled areas in Syria and Iraq .\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "A", "▁re", "bel", "▁al", "liance", "▁is", "▁fighting", "▁to", "▁cut", "▁a", "▁key", "▁route", "▁between", "▁IS", "-", "control", "led", "▁areas", "▁in", "▁Sy", "ria", "▁and", "▁Ira", "q", "▁.", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁The", "▁US", "▁government", "▁has", "▁been", "▁accused", "▁of", "▁using", "▁a", "▁secret", "ive", "▁surve", "ill", "ance", "▁program", "▁to", "▁sp", "y", "▁on", "▁the", "▁communic", "ations", "▁of", "▁foreign", "▁leaders", ",", "▁including", "▁the", "▁leaders", "▁of"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.5603896379470825, -0.4919150173664093, 0.0, -0.3787749409675598, 0.0, -0.3784675598144531, -0.9715007543563843, -0.39169448614120483, -0.017960531637072563, -8.797258487902582e-05, -0.00045003299601376057, -0.0011267272057011724, -0.00045658653834834695, -0.0026062114629894495, -3.373566141817719e-05, -1.9788545614574105e-05, 0.0, -1.4185804502631072e-05, -1.0728830375228426e-06, -0.00015841660206206143, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.29319438338279724, -0.010608942247927189, 0.0, -0.053682174533605576, 0.0, 0.0, -2.3841855067985307e-07, 0.0, 0.0, -0.056166648864746094, -0.3723989427089691, -0.9701014757156372, -0.2096775323152542, -0.8331072926521301, -0.8621397614479065, -0.0029264739714562893, -0.8934330940246582, -0.5148764848709106, -0.15673744678497314, -0.026003381237387657, -0.45992761850357056, 0.0, 0.0, -0.27880242466926575, -5.113947918289341e-05, -0.026607640087604523, 0.0, 0.0, -0.05598699301481247, -0.08497025072574615, 0.0, -7.152555099310121e-07, -0.703032910823822, -0.0019152885070070624, -0.10941042751073837, -7.426462980220094e-05, -0.3054703176021576, -0.010097256861627102, 0.0], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "A": -0.5603896379470825, "▁re": -0.4919150173664093, "bel": 0.0, "▁al": -0.3787749409675598, "liance": 0.0, "▁is": -0.3784675598144531, "▁fighting": -0.9715007543563843, "▁to": -5.113947918289341e-05, "▁cut": -0.017960531637072563, "▁a": -0.5148764848709106, "▁key": -0.00045003299601376057, "▁route": -0.0011267272057011724, "▁between": -0.00045658653834834695, "▁IS": -0.0026062114629894495, "-": -3.373566141817719e-05, "control": -1.9788545614574105e-05, "led": 0.0, "▁areas": -1.4185804502631072e-05, "▁in": -1.0728830375228426e-06, "▁Sy": -0.00015841660206206143, "ria": 0.0, "▁and": 0.0, "▁Ira": 0.0, "q": 0.0, "▁.": -0.29319438338279724, "##": -0.053682174533605576, "#": 0.0, "Art": -2.3841855067985307e-07, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "▁The": -0.056166648864746094, "▁US": -0.3723989427089691, "▁government": -0.9701014757156372, "▁has": -0.2096775323152542, "▁been": -0.8331072926521301, "▁accused": -0.8621397614479065, "▁of": 0.0, "▁using": -0.8934330940246582, "▁secret": -0.15673744678497314, "ive": -0.026003381237387657, "▁surve": -0.45992761850357056, "ill": 0.0, "ance": 0.0, "▁program": -0.27880242466926575, "▁sp": -0.026607640087604523, "y": 0.0, "▁on": 0.0, "▁the": -0.3054703176021576, "▁communic": -0.08497025072574615, "ations": 0.0, "▁foreign": -0.703032910823822, "▁leaders": -0.010097256861627102, ",": -0.10941042751073837, "▁including": -7.426462980220094e-05}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

He also played a key role in reviewing statements after Hillsborough. Deputy Chief Constable Peter Hayes and Assistant Chief Constable Walter Jackson are connected to both cases. The officers, who were involved in a review of the evidence after Orgreave and have links to Hillsborough, have both denied any wrongdoing. Mr Metcalf did not wish to comment on Orgreave when approached by the BBC. About 10,000 strikers and 5,000 police officers clashed at Orgreave coking plant in June 1984. Mr Hayes ordered a review of the way evidence had been gathered about Orgreave and was later involved in co-ordinating the force's evidence after the disaster at the Sheffield stadium. Mr Jackson was given the job of reviewing the Orgreave evidence and was at Hillsborough to watch the FA Cup semi-final after signing off the policing plan. The parallels between Hillsborough and Orgreave have been drawn before. Now evidence is starting to emerge showing the actual links, the names of people involved in the aftermath of both. There have been claims the way South Yorkshire Police conducted themselves after 'The Battle of Orgreave' fed into their response to the Hillsborough disaster. There have been growing calls for some form of investigation to fully understand what happened during the miners' strike and how that may have shown a culture within the South Yorkshire force that endured long after. But it should also be remembered these are very different incidents. Nobody died at Orgreave. Although miners were put on trial, the cases collapsed so there was no miscarriage of justice. That said, the miners have always carried a sense of injustice about what happened. Their calls for an inquiry now have the backing of some of the Hillsborough families. It's up to the home secretary to decide what happens next. Mr Metcalf wrote a note saying he had been told some of the police statements did not match the video evidence at Orgreave. His note also records Mr Metcalfe as saying that he had been told that senior officers were reluctant to provide anything that might undermine the case. Last year, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said it had identified possible cases of attempting to pervert the course of justice in relation to Orgreave. However, the police watchdog decided an investigation was not in the public interest. Former miners' union president Arthur Scargill has called for an inquiry into the Battle of Orgreave disorder. More than 120 officers and pickets were injured and 93 people were arrested following clashes at the coking plant. Campaigners have called on Dave Jones, the interim chief constable of South Yorkshire Police, to open up the force's archives on Orgreave. The Orgreave Truth and Justice Campaign said it wanted Mr Jones to intervene in its legal bid to push Home Secretary Theresa May to hold a public inquiry. Mr Jones said he would \"welcome an appropriate independent assessment of Orgreave\". \"The Hillsborough inquests have brought into sharp focus the need to understand\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nThe BBC has revealed the links between the police force involved in the Hillsborough disaster and the Orgreave miners' strike.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "The", "▁BBC", "▁has", "▁revealed", "▁the", "▁links", "▁between", "▁the", "▁police", "▁force", "▁involved", "▁in", "▁the", "▁Hills", "borough", "▁dis", "aster", "▁and", "▁the", "▁Or", "gre", "ave", "▁min", "ers", "'", "▁strike", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁The", "▁new", "▁law", "▁will", "▁require", "▁the", "▁government", "▁to", "▁publish", "▁a", "▁list", "▁of", "▁all", "▁the", "▁countries", "▁where", "▁British", "▁citizens", "▁are", "▁being", "▁held", "▁in", "▁det", "ention", "▁without", "▁charge", "▁or", "▁trial"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.5293910503387451, -0.013778219930827618, -0.0036562515888363123, -0.4688275456428528, -0.7381432056427002, -0.17911429703235626, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -0.013453886844217777, -0.10179847478866577, -0.24391937255859375, -0.3730880618095398, -3.0040289857424796e-05, -3.6954195820726454e-05, -0.1114300787448883, 0.0, -3.123234637314454e-05, 0.0, -1.7165990357170813e-05, -0.001534238108433783, -0.5857977867126465, 0.0, 0.0, -0.7359797954559326, -2.9802276912960224e-06, -4.887569048150908e-06, -0.003291548229753971, -0.20228368043899536, -0.5187305212020874, 0.0, -3.123234637314454e-05, 0.0, 0.0, -1.1920922133867862e-06, 0.0, 0.0, -0.05956974998116493, -0.5207048058509827, -1.3171298503875732, -0.2862427830696106, -1.030767798423767, -1.1452910900115967, -0.023630306124687195, -3.814689989667386e-06, -0.14144518971443176, -0.10587327182292938, -0.82611083984375, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -0.021021539345383644, -0.356608122587204, -0.17142683267593384, -0.9278629422187805, -0.3403296172618866, -0.17796824872493744, -0.08368906378746033, -0.06047067418694496, -0.5064069628715515, -0.538010835647583, -1.0024685859680176, 0.0, -0.09198883175849915, -0.506464958190918, -0.03974219411611557, 0.0], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "The": -0.5293910503387451, "▁BBC": -0.013778219930827618, "▁has": -0.0036562515888363123, "▁revealed": -0.4688275456428528, "▁the": -0.356608122587204, "▁links": -0.17911429703235626, "▁between": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "▁police": -0.10179847478866577, "▁force": -0.24391937255859375, "▁involved": -0.3730880618095398, "▁in": -0.538010835647583, "▁Hills": -0.1114300787448883, "borough": 0.0, "▁dis": -3.123234637314454e-05, "aster": 0.0, "▁and": -1.7165990357170813e-05, "▁Or": -0.5857977867126465, "gre": 0.0, "ave": 0.0, "▁min": -0.7359797954559326, "ers": -2.9802276912960224e-06, "'": -4.887569048150908e-06, "▁strike": -0.003291548229753971, ".": -0.20228368043899536, "##": -3.123234637314454e-05, "#": 0.0, "Art": -1.1920922133867862e-06, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "▁The": -0.05956974998116493, "▁new": -0.5207048058509827, "▁law": -1.3171298503875732, "▁will": -0.2862427830696106, "▁require": -1.030767798423767, "▁government": -0.023630306124687195, "▁to": -3.814689989667386e-06, "▁publish": -0.14144518971443176, "▁a": -0.10587327182292938, "▁list": -0.82611083984375, "▁of": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "▁all": -0.021021539345383644, "▁countries": -0.17142683267593384, "▁where": -0.9278629422187805, "▁British": -0.3403296172618866, "▁citizens": -0.17796824872493744, "▁are": -0.08368906378746033, "▁being": -0.06047067418694496, "▁held": -0.5064069628715515, "▁det": -1.0024685859680176, "ention": 0.0, "▁without": -0.09198883175849915, "▁charge": -0.506464958190918, "▁or": -0.03974219411611557, "▁trial": 0.0}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

The rioting came after the funeral of Freddie Gray, a black man fatally injured in police custody in Baltimore. A week-long curfew has been announced and thousands of troops have been deployed to the city. The National Guard has been sent to Baltimore to stop unrest for the first time since 1968, when some of the city's neighbourhoods went up in flames after the assassination of the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. On Tuesday evening, hundreds of protesters took to the streets to express their frustration with what they see as excessive police force. The peaceful demonstrations were a contrast to the day before, when about 200 people were arrested as more than 100 cars were set alight and 15 buildings destroyed. Mr Obama harshly criticised \"a handful of people\" for \"senseless violence and destruction\". \"That is not a protest, that is not a statement, they are stealing.\" But the US president said the rioting had distracted from the frustration over Gray's death. \"This has been a slow-rolling crisis. This has been going on for a long time. This is not new. And we shouldn't pretend that it's new,\" Mr Obama said. He added such problems would not be solved just by changes to policing. \"It would require everybody saying this is important, this is significant, and that we don't just pay attention to these communities when a CVS burns and we don't just pay attention when a young man gets shot or has his spine snapped.\" At an afternoon briefing, Baltimore Captain Eric Kowalczyk was asked why the police had not responded with more resources to prevent fires and rioting. He said police had originally deployed for a \"high school event\", expecting young students. \"I don't think there's anyone in the country that would expect us to deploy automatic weapons and armoured vehicles to an event with 13, 14 and 15 year olds,\" but saw it turned into an incident that drew in older troublemakers and escalated in violence. It's been hours since the CVS was set alight here at Pennsylvania Avenue in Baltimore, but fire fighters are still battling the flames. Earlier the stench of burning fumes filled the air as groups of people, armed with brooms and bin bags helped clear the mess from the night before. As the day progressed the crowds of protestors built up. A line of police, wearing full riot gear and carrying batons and shields have been blocking one of the road's here. For most of the afternoon protestors, danced and beat drums close by. There was the air of a carnival - a contrast to the violence this same area witnesses just the night before. At one point things did get a little tense. A conversation between protestors and police ended with pepper spray being directed at the crowds. But things have been calm overall. Protestors formed a human chain as the sun beat down on this bruised city. As nightfall a there'll be a curfew.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nPresident Barack Obama has condemned the violence and looting that has taken place in Baltimore, Maryland, following the funeral of Freddie Gray, a black man fatally injured in police custody .

The unexpected message has propelled the short film to more than two and a half million views on YouTube in just three days. Spoilers follow below - you may want to watch the video to the end first. It was created by the Sandy Hook Promise group, set up by family members of the victims of the Sandy Hook school shooting. On December 14, 2012, 20 children and six adults were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School by 20-year-old Adam Lanza, who had killed his own mother earlier that morning. He was a former student of the school. \"When you don't know what to look for or can't recognize what you are seeing, it can be easy to miss warning signs or dismiss them as unimportant,\" said Nicole Hockley from Sandy Hook Promise, whose son Dylan died in the shooting. \"Everyone has the power to intervene and get help. These actions can save lives.\" In the aftermath of the 2012 shooting, Barack Obama called for action on gun control, despite the political difficulties. But three years later, he called gun control the greatest frustration of his presidency, as the US Congress repeatedly blocked moves to tighten restrictions. The gun control movement reached a peak in the summer when more than 200 Democratic politicians staged a sit-in at the House of Representatives to demand a vote on restricting firearm purchases, in the wake of the Pulse nightclub shooting in Florida. The Gun Violence Archive non-profit organisation maintains a \"mass shooting tracker\" of attacks where four or more people were shot in a single incident. It estimates that so far in 2016, 425 people have been killed in 362 mass shootings in the United States. It says there were 333 mass shootings last year, and 275 two years ago. The new President-elect Donald Trump, however, frequently expressed support for the second amendment - the right to bear arms - during his campaign, saying his rival Hilary Clinton wanted to abolish it. On one occasion, he caused a significant controversy when he suggested gun rights supporters could somehow stop Ms Clinton's campaign.

Qualcomm is best known for making processors that power smartphones. However, one analyst suggested the device was too bulky to appeal beyond a niche enthusiast audience. The $349 (Â£215) gadget is being made available via only Qualcomm's website to US customers, and the company said it was \"unlikely\" it would sell the watch elsewhere. The Toq is designed to be paired with any smartphone running Android 4.0.3 or higher. It allows its owner to receive and send text messages, manage reminders and view other information - such as weather forecasts or stock prices - obtained via their handset. There is no software store for the watch itself, but existing handset apps can be adapted to send details to its display and activate a vibrate function. In addition it can be used to accept or reject calls, and control what music is being played from the linked phone's library. The company says that the watch's key innovation is its use of its proprietary Mirasol technology. Rob Chandok, president of Qualcomm Interactive Platforms, described this as being similar to the e-ink displays commonly used by e-book readers and another smartwatch - the Pebble - but better. \"In addition to the fact it offers colour, the refresh rate of Mirasol can be 30 frames a second, which allows you to build a touch interface,\" he told the BBC. \"That's tremendously important when you are trying to offer some of these experiences. \"In an e-ink display you can't refresh the screen fast enough to follow the finger.\" Mirasol is significantly less power-hungry than the OLED tech used by Samsung's Galaxy Gear watch, meaning that unlike its rival, its screen does not have to turn itself off when angled away from the user's face to extend battery life. Sony's Smartwatch 2 does offer an always-on LCD display - however, it requires the user to switch on a backlight in dim conditions. Although Qualcomm suggests the Toq's lack of an on/off switch makes it the superior option, Mr Chandok acknowledged that the Toq display's graphics were not as vibrant or crisp as the alternatives. \"But we've got other versions of Mirasol in the pipeline that are going to have a better colour gamut and vibrancy,\" he added. Qualcomm has also included three other technologies it has developed that it hopes will attract the attention of manufacturers: Mr Chandok said \"tens of thousands, but not hundreds of thousands\" of the watches were being produced, adding that its appeal was likely to be limited to an \"early adopter\" crowd. \"We would consider making more if the demand were high,\" he said. \"But our preference is for our partners to bring out products [using the new technologies] in the next six months, and we're working hard with a few people to do that.\" He declined to name the companies involved, but did reveal that in theory the Toq could be made compatible with Apple's iPhones. \"We limited the spend\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nQualcomm has launched a smartwatch called the Toq, which uses its own Mirasol display technology and three other new technologies.

His lawyer says he played \"no part\" in an alleged attempt to extort money from fellow French international Mathieu Valbuena. The two men reportedly had an exchange during a training session. According to French media, Mr Benzema mentioned the tape to the midfielder during a national team training session at Clairefontaine in early October. A source close to inquiry, quoted by told AFP news agency, said the 27-year-old star told investigators on Thursday he had approached Mr Valbuena about the tape on behalf of \"a childhood friend\". France coach Didier Deschamps left both players out of his squad selected on Thursday for matches against Germany and England later in November. The prosecutor's office earlier confirmed that Mr Benzema was now under formal investigation for complicity in attempted blackmail and participation in a criminal conspiracy. When a suspect is placed under formal investigation, he or she is then examined by a judge, who determines whether there is sufficient evidence for the suspect to be charged. If formal charges do follow and he is convicted, Mr Benzema could face a minimum jail sentence of five years, the prosecutor said. Meanwhile the court has banned the striker from contacting his France team-mate, or any other people charged in the case. Speaking to reporters after the ruling, Mr Benzema's lawyer, Sylvain Cormier, said his client was adamant he was not guilty of the charges. \"Karim Benzema has nothing to hide,\" he said. \"He supports his friend, Mathieu Valbuena, with all his heart. He took no part, I state this again - no part - in the blackmail or blackmail attempts.\" \"Karim Benzema will show he acted in good faith, and I hope this will be seen as soon as possible,\" Mr Cormier added. Whether or not the footballer is charged, correspondents say the formal investigation exposes him to a lengthy period of doubt ahead of the Euro 2016 tournament that France hosts next year. French coach Deschamps refused to comment on the legal case on Thursday but said Mr Benzema had been injured. He added that Lyon midfielder Mr Valbuena was not in an emotional state to play in upcoming games against Germany and England. Karim Benzema is the top scorer in the France team, so doubts about his participation at Euro 2016 represent a cloud over Les Bleus as they aim to make the most of their host status. The Real Madrid striker has scored 27 goals in 81 appearances for his country, more than double the number scored by fellow France striker Olivier Giroud, and apart from missing out at the 2010 World Cup, has been a mainstay in the team since making his debut in 2007. Benzema is regarded as one of Europe's top strikers, but despite winning honours at Real Madrid, he is yet to make a telling contribution at a major tournament for his country. Sources have told French media that a relative of Mr Benzema was contacted by the blackmailers, in an attempt to\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nKarim Benzema, a French national team player, has been placed under formal investigation for complicity in attempted blackmail and participation in a criminal conspiracy.

It is feared that the attack could leave US security personnel or their families open to blackmail. The agency involved, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), is yet to comment on the reports. Officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to the Associated Press (AP) news agency, believe the attackers have targeted the forms submitted by intelligence and military personnel for security clearances. The document includes personal information - everything from eye colour, to financial history, to past substance abuse, as well as contact details for the individual's friends and relatives. A 127-page vetting document called Standard Form 86 may have been accessed. Among the questions potential employees are asked: A White House statement said investigators had a \"high degree of confidence\" that background information on government employees had been accessed. Joel Brenner, a former US counterintelligence official, called the data a \"gold mine\" for hackers. It is also believed the breach of personal data of US government workers announced last week may be far larger than previously reported. Initial estimates put the number of people potentially affected at four million, but officials close to the investigation told AP that as many as 14 million might be involved. The US has said the hackers, thought to be behind both attacks, are believed to be based in China. Beijing called the claims \"irresponsible\". The Obama administration meanwhile announced further measures to beef up cybersecurity on Friday. \"Recent events underscore the need to accelerate the administration's cyber strategy and confront aggressive, persistent malicious actors that continue to target our nation's cyber infrastructure,\" a White House statement said.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nA second major hack of US government personnel data has been revealed .\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "A", "▁second", "▁major", "▁hack", "▁of", "▁US", "▁government", "▁personnel", "▁data", "▁has", "▁been", "▁revealed", "▁.", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁The", "▁US", "▁government", "▁has", "▁revealed", "▁that", "▁a", "▁second", "▁major", "▁hack", "▁of", "▁government", "▁personnel", "▁data", "▁has", "▁been", "▁revealed", "▁.", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁The", "▁US", "▁government", "▁has", "▁revealed", "▁that", "▁a", "▁second", "▁major", "▁hack", "▁of", "▁government", "▁personnel", "▁data", "▁has", "▁been"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.5088379383087158, -0.0983072891831398, -0.44496679306030273, -0.041494641453027725, -0.009879973717033863, -0.026146002113819122, -0.0011077941162511706, -0.3707509934902191, -0.16478422284126282, -0.36648571491241455, -0.015459935180842876, -0.8464623689651489, -0.8901678919792175, -0.1555909514427185, 0.0, -0.004597925115376711, 0.0, 0.0, -8.940656698541716e-06, 0.0, 0.0, -0.12392266094684601, -0.08369849622249603, -0.024560462683439255, -0.08397090435028076, -0.3651919364929199, -0.04045441746711731, -0.04226218909025192, -0.004235583357512951, -0.0007309625507332385, -0.0022904847282916307, -0.0001774868869688362, -0.7759036421775818, -6.174850568640977e-05, -3.1709168979432434e-05, -0.004334460012614727, -0.0007934997556731105, -0.000658057106193155, -0.07922679930925369, -0.752704381942749, -4.768370445162873e-07, -9.059865078597795e-06, 0.0, 0.0, -4.291525328881107e-06, 0.0, 0.0, -0.07895375043153763, -1.1920922133867862e-06, 0.0, -1.4305012882687151e-05, -1.4305104514278355e-06, -0.00024029705673456192, 0.0, -2.3841855067985307e-07, 0.0, -5.960462772236497e-07, -4.768370445162873e-07, -3.576278118089249e-07, 0.0, 0.0, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -5.960462772236497e-07], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "A": -0.5088379383087158, "▁second": -2.3841855067985307e-07, "▁major": 0.0, "▁hack": -5.960462772236497e-07, "▁of": -4.768370445162873e-07, "▁US": -1.1920922133867862e-06, "▁government": -3.576278118089249e-07, "▁personnel": 0.0, "▁data": 0.0, "▁has": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "▁been": -5.960462772236497e-07, "▁revealed": -1.4305104514278355e-06, "▁.": -0.07922679930925369, "##": -9.059865078597795e-06, "#": 0.0, "Art": -4.291525328881107e-06, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "▁The": -0.07895375043153763, "▁that": -0.00024029705673456192, "▁a": 0.0}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

Cardiff North Labour MP MP Anna McMorrin found some warm words about the Conservative whose job she took. \"I know how hard Craig worked to represent the constituency over the past two years,\" she told MPs on Monday. Gower Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi didn't mention Byron Davies by name but said on Thursday: \"I would also like to pay tribute to my predecessor who served the constituency to the best of his ability.\" Ms McMorrin went on to give her analysis of the Brexit referendum vote - her city voted to remain in the EU. \"The vote in many parts of Wales was not a vote against Europe or the concept or the reality of the European Union,\" she said. \"It was a vote against politicsâ€”against the reality of the decisions taken here. \"The cumulative impact of benefit cuts and reductions in public spending has hit the poorest hardest, so I intend to use my time here to speak up against a failed austerity where the richest people have forced the poorest people to pay the price.\" She added her name to an amendment to the Queen's Speech calling for the UK to remain inside the single market and the customs union.\" Ms Antoniazzi used her speech to oppose fracking and urge ministers to sign off the proposed Swansea tidal lagoon. She also reflected on her own heritage. \"My Italian family name is embedded in the Gower constituency,\" she said. \"The introduction of cafe culture to the people of South Wales comes predominantly from the families of Bardi - and yes, you have ice cream to thank me for.\" Business Secretary Greg Clark told her he had sampled some of that ice cream while campaigning for her predecessor. A friend had found that \"Gower\" and \"Tonia\" were searched for more than 20 times on her daughter's tablet computer. \"When questioned she told her mother, isn't it amazing that we live somewhere that anyone can become an MP you don't have to be rich, you don't have to go to a posh school you just have to work hard. \"And with more than 20 years as a teacher Amelie's words ring so true for the schoolchildren of Gower, Wales and the United Kingdom because ambition is critical,\" she added.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nWelsh MPs have been making their maiden speeches in the House of Commons.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "Wel", "sh", "▁MP", "s", "▁have", "▁been", "▁making", "▁their", "▁ma", "iden", "▁speech", "es", "▁in", "▁the", "▁House", "▁of", "▁Commons", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁The", "▁", "1", "9", "9", "0", "s", "▁was", "▁a", "▁de", "cade", "▁that", "▁saw", "▁the", "▁rise", "▁of", "▁the", "▁internet", ",", "▁the", "▁fall", "▁of", "▁the", "▁Berlin", "▁Wall", ",", "▁the", "▁rise", "▁of", "▁the", "▁euro", "▁and", "▁the", "▁fall", "▁of", "▁the", "▁Soviet"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.5331721901893616, 0.0, -0.0797228068113327, -3.576278118089249e-07, -0.0538058802485466, -0.047231920063495636, -0.2703772783279419, -0.363407164812088, -0.004448043182492256, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.009238471277058125, -0.36127281188964844, -0.035065289586782455, 0.0, 0.0, -0.3645314574241638, -0.02007581852376461, 0.0, -0.006767685525119305, 0.0, 0.0, -2.50339189733495e-06, 0.0, 0.0, -0.04422307386994362, -0.7420634031295776, -0.18516536056995392, -0.0511946864426136, -0.78249192237854, -1.1438337564468384, -0.0005053196800872684, -0.6041602492332458, -0.07969584316015244, -0.26536819338798523, 0.0, -0.08590295910835266, -0.0901455283164978, -0.016636569052934647, -0.0007207180024124682, -0.00024041623692028224, -0.0007909983396530151, -0.009382677264511585, -0.25237852334976196, -0.0004618293314706534, -0.0016295737586915493, 0.0, -0.004436056595295668, -0.00015853578224778175, -6.890059739816934e-05, -0.36088407039642334, -0.5063688158988953, -0.11436686664819717, -4.5536911784438416e-05, -0.00392892025411129, -0.005302294623106718, -0.11736311763525009, -0.00014888131408952177, -0.2609710693359375, 0.0, -0.01836416684091091, -0.015458174049854279], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "Wel": -0.5331721901893616, "sh": 0.0, "▁MP": -0.0797228068113327, "s": -0.0005053196800872684, "▁have": -0.0538058802485466, "▁been": -0.047231920063495636, "▁making": -0.2703772783279419, "▁their": -0.363407164812088, "▁ma": -0.004448043182492256, "iden": 0.0, "▁speech": 0.0, "es": 0.0, "▁in": -0.009238471277058125, "▁the": -0.01836416684091091, "▁House": -0.035065289586782455, "▁of": 0.0, "▁Commons": 0.0, ".": -0.3645314574241638, "##": -0.006767685525119305, "#": 0.0, "Art": -2.50339189733495e-06, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "▁The": -0.04422307386994362, "▁": -0.7420634031295776, "1": -0.18516536056995392, "9": -0.78249192237854, "0": -1.1438337564468384, "▁was": -0.6041602492332458, "▁a": -0.07969584316015244, "▁de": -0.26536819338798523, "cade": 0.0, "▁that": -0.08590295910835266, "▁saw": -0.0901455283164978, "▁rise": -0.11436686664819717, "▁internet": -0.009382677264511585, ",": -0.36088407039642334, "▁fall": -0.2609710693359375, "▁Berlin": -0.00015853578224778175, "▁Wall": -6.890059739816934e-05, "▁euro": -0.005302294623106718, "▁and": -0.11736311763525009, "▁Soviet": -0.015458174049854279}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

Mr Kopel, who was inducted to the Dundee United Hall of Fame in 2011, started his career with Manchester United as a schoolboy in 1964. He made 12 appearances for the Old Trafford side, including a European appearance against Anderlecht, before moving to Blackburn Rovers in 1969. He was signed by United manager Jim McLean on New Year's Day 1972, and became a mainstay at the right-back position in a team which won back to back Scottish League Cup honours in 1979 and 1980, the club's first major trophies. After leaving Tannadice to take up a coaching position with Arbroath in 1982, he returned to United on several occasions to help out with the reserves. A spokesman for the club said: \"Our thoughts are with all of his family and friends at this very sad time. \"An indication of the affection with which he was held by all Arabs is illustrated by the fact that a supporters' club was named in his honour and by the genuinely warm welcome he received at the many functions and events he attended over the years.\" Alzheimer Scotland added: \"Deeply saddened to hear of the death of Frank Kopel. Our sincere condolences to his family and friends.\" Mr Kopel was diagnosed with a mixture of vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease in 2009. His wife Amanda mounted a campaign to raise awareness of the strain on carers looking after people with early-onset dementia, and addressed the Scottish Parliament's public petitions committee. She has called for free personal care for dementia sufferers under 65, and health secretary Alex Neil pledged to bring her concerns to Parliament after meeting the couple at their Kirriemuir home last month.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nA former Dundee United player who was diagnosed with dementia in 2009 has died .\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "A", "▁former", "▁D", "und", "ee", "▁United", "▁player", "▁who", "▁was", "▁diagn", "osed", "▁with", "▁de", "ment", "ia", "▁in", "▁", "2", "0", "0", "9", "▁has", "▁died", "▁.", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁A", "▁man", "▁who", "▁died", "▁in", "▁a", "▁crash", "▁on", "▁the", "▁A", "1", "▁in", "▁North", "▁York", "shire", "▁was", "▁a", "▁former", "▁police", "▁officer", ",", "▁the", "▁force", "▁said", "▁.", "▁The", "▁", "5", "9", "-", "year"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.0026491330936551094, -0.000871040450874716, -0.00374045898206532, 0.0, 0.0, -2.145764938177308e-06, -0.5280795693397522, -0.27310386300086975, -0.23611599206924438, -0.3664063811302185, 0.0, 0.0, -7.259582343976945e-05, 0.0, 0.0, -0.36386045813560486, -3.576278118089249e-07, 0.0, 0.0, -1.1920928244535389e-07, 0.0, -2.586808113846928e-05, -3.576278118089249e-07, -0.8014101982116699, -0.17347881197929382, 0.0, -0.25251874327659607, 0.0, 0.0, -2.3841855067985307e-07, 0.0, 0.0, -0.05501895025372505, -0.6949237585067749, -0.10084135830402374, -0.018603837117552757, -0.2585810720920563, -0.006641339045017958, -0.10175798833370209, -0.1863379329442978, -0.07951254397630692, -0.506487250328064, -0.2559405565261841, -0.792089581489563, -0.07583712041378021, -0.052719246596097946, 0.0, -0.5890376567840576, -0.3831489682197571, -0.10299947112798691, -0.8654181957244873, -4.768370445162873e-07, -0.03628635033965111, -0.8891406059265137, -0.00027378625236451626, -0.5092065930366516, -0.18596811592578888, -0.015036101453006268, -0.11891663074493408, -1.3687143325805664, -2.1296980381011963, -0.015397603623569012, 0.0], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "A": -0.0026491330936551094, "▁former": -0.10299947112798691, "▁D": -0.00374045898206532, "und": 0.0, "ee": 0.0, "▁United": -2.145764938177308e-06, "▁player": -0.5280795693397522, "▁who": -0.10084135830402374, "▁was": -0.5890376567840576, "▁diagn": -0.3664063811302185, "osed": 0.0, "▁with": 0.0, "▁de": -7.259582343976945e-05, "ment": 0.0, "ia": 0.0, "▁in": -0.792089581489563, "▁": -0.11891663074493408, "2": 0.0, "0": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "9": -2.1296980381011963, "▁has": -2.586808113846928e-05, "▁died": -0.018603837117552757, "▁.": -0.18596811592578888, "##": -0.25251874327659607, "#": 0.0, "Art": -2.3841855067985307e-07, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "▁A": -0.506487250328064, "▁man": -0.6949237585067749, "▁a": -0.3831489682197571, "▁crash": -0.10175798833370209, "▁on": -0.1863379329442978, "▁the": -0.8891406059265137, "1": -0.2559405565261841, "▁North": -0.07583712041378021, "▁York": -0.052719246596097946, "shire": 0.0, "▁police": -0.8654181957244873, "▁officer": -4.768370445162873e-07, ",": -0.03628635033965111, "▁force": -0.00027378625236451626, "▁said": -0.5092065930366516, "▁The": -0.015036101453006268, "5": -1.3687143325805664, "-": -0.015397603623569012, "year": 0.0}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

Porridge will return for a special episode, again written by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais. Set 40 years on, Kevin Bishop will play Fletcher's prison inmate grandson. Nicknamed \"Fletch\" Fletcher, Nigel is behind bars for a series of cyber crimes. Beckinsale said in an interview for Radio 5 live, Afternoon Edition: \"I don't think that's such a terrible idea. I think that's quite nice really. \"When it's beloved characters and a beloved project, it's quite nice to have an imaginary, 'what is their grandson doing?'\" But Beckinsale, whose new film is Love & Friendship - a romantic comedy based on Jane Austen's novel Lady Susan - has no desire to make a cameo in her father's old show. \"In Porridge? You've got to be joking. It's a boy's prison. I'm not that versatile. Tea lady?\" Her father died from cardiac arrest at the age of 31 in 1979. He appeared in all three series of Porridge between 1974 and 1977 and finished making the film version a few weeks before his death. Beckinsale, who starred in 2012's reboot of Total Recall, which originally starred Arnold Schwarzenegger, does not now believe remakes are a good idea, she says. \"I think it's a shame sometimes when they take something that is almost perfect or perfect and then remake it. That's a silly idea. \"They should remake things that aren't very good and have another go at it.\" The new episode of Porridge will be broadcast this summer as part of a landmark sitcom season to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the start of Hancock's Half Hour on BBC TV. It will include contemporary follow-ups to Are You Being Served?, Keeping Up Appearances and Up Pompeii! while lost episodes of Steptoe and Son, Till Death Do Us Part and Hancock's Half Hour will be remade from their original scripts for BBC Four. The interview with Kate Beckinsale can be heard on Radio 5 live's Afternoon Edition on Tuesday 31 May at 1300.

Mylan chief executive Heather Bresch said the company had spent hundreds of millions of dollars improving the product since buying the product from Merck in 2007. \"Our decision to launch a generic alternative to EpiPen is an extraordinary commercial response,\" she said. \"We determined that bypassing the brand system in this case and offering an additional alternative was the best option.\" The move is unusual because the branded version is still under patent and other rival treatments have failed to get regulatory clearance. The product generates annual sales of $1bn for Mylan. Bernstein analyst Ronny Gal said: \"We suspect Mylan will continue to receive some heat for its price increases and there will be heightened pressure on FDA [regulator the Food and Drug Administration] to bring competition to the market.\" Ms Bresch also blamed the complex US health care system for the price rises and said that Mylan took just $274 of the $600 list price, while insurers, pharmacies and other parties shared the rest. How much individuals pay for an EpiPen prescription can depend on their insurance coverage. Politicians and parents have challenged the price hikes, with Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton calling them \"outrageous\" and unjustified. The outcry over EpiPen price rises sent Mylan shares falling about 12% last week. The stock was flat at $43.04 in afternoon trading in New York. Actor Sarah Jessica Parker, who had endorsed EpiPens, said last week she was ending her relationship with Mylan. She had previously spoken about the importance of the treatment to her family because of her son's peanut allergy. Other drug makers including Valeant, Turing and Pfizer have come under fire in recent months for sharp price increases.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nMylan said it expected to start selling a cheaper generic product \"in several weeks\" at a list price of $300 (Â£230).

The apartment building came crashing down on Thursday. Correspondents say building collapses are common in India, with poor construction practices often blamed. In pictures: Mumbai building collapse There is huge demand for housing, and corruption often leads to cost-cutting and a lack of safety inspections, correspondents say. Police commissioner K P Raghuvanshi said the builders were arrested for allegedly paying bribes to police and municipal officials to construct the building in the Mumbai suburb of Thane without any official sanction. Mr Raghuvanshi said on Sunday that the nine would be formally charged with culpable homicide and causing death by negligence, once the investigation into the accident had been completed. If convicted, they face sentences of up to life in prison. Most of the victims of the Thane collapse were poor daily wage earners working at the site, and their families. The dead included 30 children and 18 women. Building work had continued at the block even though four floors were already occupied. One police official told the BBC that the collapse appeared to have been caused by the use of substandard building material. Witnesses said the construction of the building started just six weeks ago, since when seven floors had been built. The eighth floor was under construction.

The 16th Century linen-fold panelling, the fireplace overmantel and the carved and moulded ceiling beams were dismantled, crated up and sent to America. \"He ended up assembling it in his billiard room in his apartment in New York,\" she said. The apartment was known as the Clarendon, said to be the largest apartment in the world. It was partly demolished in the 1930s, but the couple know the panelled rooms were taken out and stored. \"This is where we lose track of it,\" they said. \"Where did our room go? \"Did the Hearst family hold on to it? Was it sold? Was it donated to an American museum? \"We have spent years looking through archives and records but can find no trace of it anywhere.\" Numerous items of furniture, along with another whole room, were also sold off in 1921. The panelling from the dining room was also bought by Mr Hearst. But it was later discovered in a warehouse belonging to the Metropolitan Museum in New York, and was brought back to Wales and reinstalled at Gwydir in 1996.

Public Health Minister Maureen Watt welcomed the figures. \"It's tremendous news that fewer people are developing heart disease or suffering strokes, and that fewer people are dying,\" she said. \"I'm also encouraged to see that health inequalities are reducing in this area, with the gap in mortality rates between the most deprived and least deprived communities falling over time.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nThe number of deaths from heart disease has fallen by 43% in Scotland over the past decade.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "The", "▁number", "▁of", "▁death", "s", "▁from", "▁heart", "▁disease", "▁has", "▁fallen", "▁by", "▁", "4", "3", "%", "▁in", "▁Scotland", "▁over", "▁the", "▁past", "▁de", "cade", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁The", "▁UK", "▁government", "▁has", "▁announced", "▁a", "▁new", "▁strategy", "▁to", "▁tack", "le", "▁the", "▁growing", "▁problem", "▁of", "▁ant", "im", "icro", "b", "ial", "▁resistance", ".", "▁The", "▁strategy", ",", "▁published", "▁on", "▁T", "ues", "day", ",", "▁a"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.7054539918899536, -0.002553894417360425, 0.0, -0.36210083961486816, 0.0, -0.004923837725073099, -3.576278118089249e-07, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -0.5165531039237976, -0.5160483121871948, -0.006995471194386482, -0.0008958140970207751, -0.00010442188795423135, -4.768370445162873e-07, -0.00011598391574807465, -0.006358156446367502, -0.000161038784426637, -0.23129306733608246, -0.006821321789175272, -0.07889007776975632, -0.0259404256939888, 0.0, -0.052734289318323135, 0.0, 0.0, -2.3841855067985307e-07, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.252821147441864, -0.6248398423194885, -0.020840827375650406, -0.12746088206768036, -0.3365655243396759, -1.1053098440170288, -0.2506970763206482, -1.6456682682037354, -0.035609111189842224, -0.15190744400024414, 0.0, -0.5210869312286377, -0.45989489555358887, -0.06345906853675842, 0.0, -0.05282418802380562, -0.36088430881500244, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -3.6954811548639555e-06, -0.7034239172935486, -0.01117683481425047, -0.11467208713293076, -1.0082145929336548, -0.052842844277620316, -0.010599152185022831, -0.7760015726089478, 0.0, 0.0, -3.123234637314454e-05, -0.5386152863502502], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "The": -0.7054539918899536, "▁number": -0.002553894417360425, "▁of": 0.0, "▁death": -0.36210083961486816, "s": 0.0, "▁from": -0.004923837725073099, "▁heart": -3.576278118089249e-07, "▁disease": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "▁has": -0.12746088206768036, "▁fallen": -0.5160483121871948, "▁by": -0.006995471194386482, "▁": -0.0008958140970207751, "4": -0.00010442188795423135, "3": -4.768370445162873e-07, "%": -0.00011598391574807465, "▁in": -0.006358156446367502, "▁Scotland": -0.000161038784426637, "▁over": -0.23129306733608246, "▁the": -0.5210869312286377, "▁past": -0.07889007776975632, "▁de": -0.0259404256939888, "cade": 0.0, ".": -0.7034239172935486, "##": -2.3841855067985307e-07, "#": 0.0, "Art": 0.0, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "▁The": -0.01117683481425047, "▁UK": -0.6248398423194885, "▁government": -0.020840827375650406, "▁announced": -0.3365655243396759, "▁a": -0.5386152863502502, "▁new": -0.2506970763206482, "▁strategy": -0.11467208713293076, "▁to": -0.035609111189842224, "▁tack": -0.15190744400024414, "le": 0.0, "▁growing": -0.45989489555358887, "▁problem": -0.06345906853675842, "▁ant": -0.05282418802380562, "im": -0.36088430881500244, "icro": 0.0, "b": 0.0, "ial": 0.0, "▁resistance": -3.6954811548639555e-06, ",": -3.123234637314454e-05, "▁published": -0.052842844277620316, "▁on": -0.010599152185022831, "▁T": -0.7760015726089478, "ues": 0.0, "day": 0.0}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

It is believed about 1,200 jobs will be affected, including 400 in Scotland. The Scottish government said it continued to \"explore all options\" to find a viable future for Tata's sites. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told her party conference in Aberdeen on Saturday that \"if our worst fears are realised\", she would immediately establish a task force to work with the company, the trade unions and local authorities. Tata employs about 70 people at its Clydebridge plant in Cambuslang, with the remainder of its Scottish workforce based at its Dalzell plate rolling works in Motherwell. Trade union Community, which represents steel workers, said it wanted any task force to support a programme which would keep the plants open while a long-term solution was sought. Assistant general secretary John Park said: \"We are in the middle of the worst slump in steel prices in living memory and it is essential we maintain our capacity to produce steel in Scotland. \"We welcome Nicola Sturgeon's announcement of a steel task force, but it cannot simply be an exercise in managing decline. \"If the Scottish steel industry is to have a future, then Nicola Sturgeon must ensure the strategic assets at Dalzell and Clydebridge are maintained.\" Mr Park also called for a \"proper industrial strategy\" for the sector to be developed. He added: \"For steel to have that future we must secure the skills of the men and women who work in the industry. \"That is why we are calling on the Scottish government to support short-time working programme, should that be necessary over the coming weeks.\" A Scottish government spokeswoman said: \"Since last year, when Tata Steel first announced the potential sale of its long products division, the Scottish government and its agencies have been in constant contact with both Tata Steel and with the trades unions. \"We continue to be in contact to explore all possible options to find a viable future for the company's sites in Scotland.\" Labour MSP John Pentland said: \"When Grangemouth, Fergusons and Prestwick Airport were at risk, the Scottish government stepped in to provide support and to secure jobs. \"They need to do the same now - anything less will not be acceptable. \"This is an iconic industry for our nation and the men and women who work at Clydesdale and Dalzell deserve all possible support.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nA task force is to be set up to find a future for Tata's plants in Scotland.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "A", "▁task", "▁force", "▁is", "▁to", "▁be", "▁set", "▁up", "▁to", "▁find", "▁a", "▁future", "▁for", "▁T", "ata", "'", "s", "▁plants", "▁in", "▁Scotland", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁A", "▁new", "▁study", "▁suggests", "▁that", "▁the", "▁human", "▁brain", "▁is", "▁able", "▁to", "▁process", "▁the", "▁sounds", "▁of", "▁speech", "▁in", "▁a", "▁way", "▁that", "▁could", "▁help", "▁scient", "ists", "▁develop", "▁a", "▁new", "▁generation", "▁of", "▁prost", "h", "etic", "▁hearing", "▁devices"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.8464103937149048, -0.763046383857727, -0.00010442188795423135, -0.12339826673269272, -0.24148157238960266, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -0.006749924272298813, 0.0, -0.010999402962625027, -0.469142884016037, 0.0, -0.012089667841792107, 0.0, -0.05731213465332985, 0.0, -0.11812428385019302, 0.0, -0.3627581298351288, -4.768370445162873e-07, -0.002157385926693678, -0.5886316895484924, -0.004678612574934959, 0.0, -1.9788545614574105e-05, 0.0, 0.0, -1.1920928244535389e-07, 0.0, 0.0, -0.2543141841888428, -0.7331080436706543, -0.5488278865814209, -0.736511766910553, -0.0002549561613705009, -0.07669580727815628, -0.27581870555877686, -0.0031724858563393354, -0.41588491201400757, -1.0828560590744019, 0.0, -0.3077039122581482, -0.29856136441230774, -0.3551589250564575, -0.0001538873475510627, -0.9476816058158875, -0.7359567284584045, -0.07246995717287064, -0.0017156180692836642, -4.6491513785440475e-06, -0.13988599181175232, -0.13321231305599213, -0.7359734773635864, 0.0, -0.16936279833316803, -0.8367708921432495, -1.1125723123550415, -0.019323553889989853, 0.0, -0.011996619403362274, -6.890059739816934e-05, 0.0, -0.5489968657493591, -0.3608899712562561], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "A": -0.8464103937149048, "▁task": -0.763046383857727, "▁force": -0.00010442188795423135, "▁is": -0.41588491201400757, "▁to": 0.0, "▁be": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "▁set": -0.006749924272298813, "▁up": 0.0, "▁find": -0.469142884016037, "▁a": -0.8367708921432495, "▁future": -0.012089667841792107, "▁for": 0.0, "▁T": -0.05731213465332985, "ata": 0.0, "'": -0.11812428385019302, "s": 0.0, "▁plants": -0.3627581298351288, "▁in": -0.7359567284584045, "▁Scotland": -0.002157385926693678, ".": -0.5886316895484924, "##": -1.9788545614574105e-05, "#": 0.0, "Art": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "▁A": -0.2543141841888428, "▁new": -1.1125723123550415, "▁study": -0.5488278865814209, "▁suggests": -0.736511766910553, "▁that": -4.6491513785440475e-06, "▁the": -0.29856136441230774, "▁human": -0.27581870555877686, "▁brain": -0.0031724858563393354, "▁able": -1.0828560590744019, "▁process": -0.3077039122581482, "▁sounds": -0.3551589250564575, "▁of": 0.0, "▁speech": -0.9476816058158875, "▁way": -0.0017156180692836642, "▁could": -0.13988599181175232, "▁help": -0.13321231305599213, "▁scient": -0.7359734773635864, "ists": 0.0, "▁develop": -0.16936279833316803, "▁generation": -0.019323553889989853, "▁prost": -0.011996619403362274, "h": -6.890059739816934e-05, "etic": 0.0, "▁hearing": -0.5489968657493591, "▁devices": -0.3608899712562561}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

But no link was found between exposure to cigarette smoke in the womb and a decrease in fertility. The study examines data from 12,321 women born before 31 December 1972. The university said an analysis of the data also showed that women exposed to cigarette smoke in the womb were more likely to have a pregnancy than those whose mothers did not smoke. Women exposed to cigarette smoke in the womb were also likely to have a pregnancy earlier than those not exposed. Dr Sohinee Bhattacharya, a pregnancy and childbirth expert from the University of Aberdeen, said previous research had suggested there may be a \"small decrease\" in the fertility of women whose mothers smoked in pregnancy. \"This study used a databank in Aberdeen to look at the birth records of more than 12,000 women and followed them through for 40 years to see whether being born to a smoker had any impact on women's future fertility,\" she said. \"The study did not find a link between mothers' smoking and a decrease in fertility in their daughters. \"Women whose mothers smoked were more likely to have a pregnancy, but this study suggests that this could simply be linked to the fact that they were also more likely to get pregnant at an earlier age and could be related to socioeconomic status. \"Worryingly the study did find a significant increase in the chances of having a miscarriage among the women whose mothers had smoked when pregnant with them. \" The lead author of the paper, Sam Tweed, completed the work as part of his undergraduate degree and graduated from the University of Aberdeen's Medical School in June.

Shepherd's converted try and penalty saw Cornwall to a 10-6 half-time lead. Shepherd crossed again in the second half before Evan Stewart's late try for Lancashire ensured a nervy finish, but could not prevent only their second Twickenham final defeat in six years. Since 2009, Lancashire had only previously once lost the Bill Beaumont Cup, in 2012, when they were beaten by Hertfordshire. Shepherd missed a penalty in the opening minutes, but he made amends two minutes later, the Launceston scrum-half going in under the posts from 30 metres out. Steve Collins pulled a penalty back and Shepherd missed a three-point attempt of his own before Cornwall were reduced to 14 men on 27 minutes. Ben Hilton was sin-binned and Chris Johnson brought Lancashire back to within a point of their opponents from the resulting penalty. But Shepherd's penalty with five minutes left in the half, coming after Chris Briers' yellow card, ensured that the Duchy went in at the break with a 10-6 lead. Shepherd took his points tally for the County Championship to 66 when he went over shortly after the break following a line out from five metres out. That made it 15-6 and, although he failed to convert his own score, his Launceston teammate Searle pushed the gap into double figures with a 63rd minute penalty. Lancashire did not threaten Cornwall until the final 10 minutes when they put the Duchy under immense pressure. Searle was sin-binned for an infringement at the breakdown and Lancashire skipper Stewart crashed over with six minutes left, Johnson adding the extras. But Cornwall's 14 men stood firm to clinch a fourth county title.

Failure to pay the fine, or to stop a vehicle and give personal details to the police could lead to a prosecution and 1,000 euros (£727) penalty. A similar ban is being considered by the Northern Ireland Assembly. Earlier this month, Stormont Health Minister Simon Hamilton announced an amendment to a bill currently going through the assembly, which if passed, would now mean smoking in cars with children would be illegal anywhere on the island of Ireland. The Irish government signed its ban into law this week, under the Protection of Children's Health (Tobacco Smoke in Mechanically Propelled Vehicles) Act. The details were announced by Minister for Children Dr James Reilly and Minister for Health Leo Varadkar. Mr Reilly said it was a central part of his government's \"Tobacco Free Ireland\" policy. \"The Irish Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) Study 2014 found that nearly one in every five children between the ages of 10 and 17 years are exposed to toxic, carcinogenic smoke in cars,\" he said. \"Even if windows of the car are open the young person is not protected from the harmful effect of second-hand smoke.\" Mr Varadkar said: \"Children are more susceptible to the effects of second-hand smoke and may not be able to avoid exposure. \"Second hand smoke is particularly harmful to children in enclosed spaces, such as cars.\" Under the new law, drivers and passengers will be banned from smoking cigarettes, cigars or pipes when they are inside a vehicle with someone under the age of 18. Drivers will also be held responsible if they allow their passengers to smoke in front of children. The legislation does not apply to electronic cigarettes, which are exempt from the ban. In Great Britain, a law banning smoking in vehicles carrying children came into force in England and Wales in October. The Scotland government is planning to legislate on the issue next year.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nThe Irish government has signed a law banning smoking in vehicles carrying children.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "The", "▁Irish", "▁government", "▁has", "▁signed", "▁a", "▁law", "▁b", "anning", "▁sm", "oking", "▁in", "▁vehicles", "▁carrying", "▁children", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁The", "▁", "2", "0", "1", "8", "▁Winter", "▁Olympics", "▁will", "▁be", "▁the", "▁", "2", "4", "th", "▁Winter", "▁Olympics", ",", "▁scheduled", "▁to", "▁be", "▁held", "▁from", "▁", "4", "▁to", "▁", "2", "0", "▁February", "▁", "2", "0", "1", "8", "▁in", "▁P", "ye", "ong"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.4171704053878784, -0.11850173771381378, -2.50339189733495e-06, -0.0013988957507535815, -0.03555193543434143, -0.053502071648836136, -0.010598208755254745, -1.6331539882230572e-05, 0.0, -3.182837463100441e-05, 0.0, -4.768370445162873e-07, -0.07889558374881744, -0.002941807033494115, -4.410734163684538e-06, -0.15644215047359467, -0.010802481323480606, 0.0, -0.0008445986895821989, 0.0, 0.0, -1.1920922133867862e-06, 0.0, 0.0, -0.11004088073968887, -1.484757423400879, -0.2554759383201599, -0.0011832863092422485, -0.015401829965412617, -1.2100228071212769, -0.7418790459632874, -0.00024136967840604484, -0.4473065733909607, -0.010391534306108952, -0.11740223318338394, -0.2528921663761139, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -0.006720677483826876, 0.0, -0.364147812128067, -0.25193625688552856, -0.44986391067504883, -0.040776293724775314, 0.0, -1.3351351299206726e-05, 0.0, -0.010529793798923492, -2.50339189733495e-06, -0.035052742809057236, -0.0024070357903838158, 0.0, -0.0019286142196506262, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -3.576272320060525e-06, 0.0, 0.0, -7.152555099310121e-07, 0.0, -0.00024184639914892614, -0.001943010720424354, 0.0, 0.0], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "The": -0.4171704053878784, "▁Irish": -0.11850173771381378, "▁government": -2.50339189733495e-06, "▁has": -0.0013988957507535815, "▁signed": -0.03555193543434143, "▁a": -0.053502071648836136, "▁law": -0.010598208755254745, "▁b": -1.6331539882230572e-05, "anning": 0.0, "▁sm": -3.182837463100441e-05, "oking": 0.0, "▁in": -0.00024184639914892614, "▁vehicles": -0.07889558374881744, "▁carrying": -0.002941807033494115, "▁children": -4.410734163684538e-06, ".": -0.15644215047359467, "##": -0.0008445986895821989, "#": 0.0, "Art": -1.1920922133867862e-06, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "▁The": -0.11004088073968887, "▁": -3.576272320060525e-06, "2": 0.0, "0": 0.0, "1": -7.152555099310121e-07, "8": 0.0, "▁Winter": -0.364147812128067, "▁Olympics": -0.25193625688552856, "▁will": -0.4473065733909607, "▁be": -1.3351351299206726e-05, "▁the": -0.11740223318338394, "4": -0.035052742809057236, "th": 0.0, ",": -0.44986391067504883, "▁scheduled": -0.040776293724775314, "▁to": -0.0024070357903838158, "▁held": 0.0, "▁from": -0.010529793798923492, "▁February": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "▁P": -0.001943010720424354, "ye": 0.0, "ong": 0.0}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

Supported by eight former children's laureates, Riddell is asking Ms Greening to set out required standards. The government said it was up to schools to spend as they saw fit. In his letter, Riddell, supported by authors such as Michael Morpurgo, Jacqueline Wilson and Quentin Blake, said: \" I have seen personally, in my school visits up and down the country, how they promote reading for pleasure and in doing so, turn pupils into avid readers. \"I am deeply concerned that this role is not fully appreciated and, worse, is being undermined through lack of economic and intellectual investment. \"In recent months two major school library services closed in Dorset and Berkshire, and year after year the School Library Association loses members as school library provision shrinks through lack of funding.\" He said he had seen how library provision was \"wildly inconsistent\", with great examples of well-funded and staffed libraries. He said the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Libraries had asked the DfE to gather statistics on school library provision so that the extent of this problem could be understood, but this had not yet happened. Riddell also said: \"While schools face insidious pressure on budgets and staff, things cannot change. \"That is why, with the backing of my fellow laureates, I am now calling on Justine Greening and the Department of Education to act on the all-party group's request and then set out clear standards of library provision, and put into place the necessary funding.\" This way, every school would have a library service it could be proud of, with books to borrow and, wherever possible, a school librarian to help children choose, he said. A Department for Education official said reading was a key part of a child's education and ultimately helped them to reach their full potential. \"That's why we've strengthened the curriculum to focus on developing their reading and writing skills, and teaching phonics helps children acquire the basic building blocks of reading,\" the official said. \"We want all children to have the opportunity to read widely - school libraries play a role in this, and schools are responsible for deciding how to provide this service for their pupils. \"This is backed up by a record Â£40bn schools budget this year, and it is up schools to spend their funding as they see fit.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nA group of children's authors is asking the government to provide funding for school libraries.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "A", "▁group", "▁of", "▁children", "'", "s", "▁authors", "▁is", "▁asking", "▁the", "▁government", "▁to", "▁provide", "▁fund", "ing", "▁for", "▁school", "▁libraries", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁The", "▁government", "▁is", "▁to", "▁launch", "▁a", "▁review", "▁of", "▁the", "▁way", "▁in", "▁which", "▁the", "▁UK", "'", "s", "▁nuclear", "▁d", "eter", "rent", "▁is", "▁operated", "▁and", "▁maintained", ".", "▁The", "▁review", "▁will", "▁look", "▁at", "▁the", "▁costs", "▁of", "▁maintain", "ing", "▁the"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.2178148329257965, -0.3663633465766907, -2.3841855067985307e-07, -0.08832436054944992, 0.0, 0.0, -0.00027616979787126184, -0.6884424090385437, -0.13170531392097473, -0.002179034985601902, -0.000482442817883566, -0.00010442188795423135, -0.11127031594514847, -0.11858443915843964, 0.0, -0.03512042388319969, -0.010575915686786175, -2.3841855067985307e-07, -0.11060584336519241, -0.00042000532266683877, 0.0, -1.2993727978027891e-05, 0.0, 0.0, -3.576278118089249e-07, 0.0, 0.0, -0.08516447991132736, -0.8072296977043152, -0.7990147471427917, -0.032770756632089615, -0.8951753377914429, -0.0019422968616709113, -0.557307243347168, -0.05272965133190155, -0.007055013906210661, -0.5333883166313171, -0.4025607705116272, 0.0, -0.10132288932800293, -0.11973690241575241, -0.02210875041782856, 0.0, -0.7231263518333435, -0.06723636388778687, 0.0, 0.0, -0.0012222208315506577, -0.8939988017082214, -0.5439263582229614, -0.0072705443017184734, -0.6944852471351624, -0.000621840707026422, -0.003748534945771098, -0.17882245779037476, -0.5948885679244995, -0.00010501786891836673, -0.31404897570610046, -0.44259920716285706, -0.38610416650772095, -0.2393694818019867, 0.0, -0.036416247487068176], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "A": -0.2178148329257965, "▁group": -0.3663633465766907, "▁of": -0.38610416650772095, "▁children": -0.08832436054944992, "'": -0.02210875041782856, "s": 0.0, "▁authors": -0.00027616979787126184, "▁is": -0.0012222208315506577, "▁asking": -0.13170531392097473, "▁the": -0.036416247487068176, "▁government": -0.8072296977043152, "▁to": -0.032770756632089615, "▁provide": -0.11127031594514847, "▁fund": -0.11858443915843964, "ing": 0.0, "▁for": -0.03512042388319969, "▁school": -0.010575915686786175, "▁libraries": -2.3841855067985307e-07, ".": -0.6944852471351624, "##": -1.2993727978027891e-05, "#": 0.0, "Art": -3.576278118089249e-07, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "▁The": -0.000621840707026422, "▁launch": -0.8951753377914429, "▁a": -0.0019422968616709113, "▁review": -0.003748534945771098, "▁way": -0.5333883166313171, "▁in": -0.4025607705116272, "▁which": 0.0, "▁UK": -0.11973690241575241, "▁nuclear": -0.7231263518333435, "▁d": -0.06723636388778687, "eter": 0.0, "rent": 0.0, "▁operated": -0.8939988017082214, "▁and": -0.5439263582229614, "▁maintained": -0.0072705443017184734, "▁will": -0.17882245779037476, "▁look": -0.5948885679244995, "▁at": -0.00010501786891836673, "▁costs": -0.44259920716285706, "▁maintain": -0.2393694818019867}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

Farmers have warned they will go out of business if they do not receive higher prices for milk. They have held protests at supermarkets to show their frustration that they are currently paid less than the cost of production. Mrs O'Neill added: \"I and farming industry representatives from Northern Ireland were also adamant that pursuing opportunities in opening new markets tomorrow will not address the crisis our farmers are facing today.\" The minister and the representatives were joined at the meeting by their counterparts from Scotland, Wales and the UK's farming unions. The meeting was called to address a number of issues facing the farming industry, especially the dairy sector. \"It is clear that European support for our farmers is vital right now,\" said Mrs O'Neill. \"The dairy sector in Northern Ireland, which is heavily reliant on exports, has been hit hard by adverse exchange rates and poor market conditions. \"Farm gate milk prices are now below the cost of production. Assistance is required. Our circumstances are unique and extreme. \"While it is good that my counterparts in Wales and Scotland are committed to influencing Liz Truss to act speedily, I am clear that raising the intervention price threshold is the key lever to effect positive change in the short term.\" The minister intends to ask the EU Commissioner Phil Hogan to raise the intervention threshold price when she meets him in September. She will also attend the specially-convened Agriculture Council in Brussels on 7 September. Environment Secretary Ms Truss said: \"I recognise the seriousness of the current situation for the dairy industry and for farming as a whole. \"Our hard working farmers and the Â£100bn food and farming industry are vital for our economy and our countryside. \"I want to see this situation taken seriously by the EU who have the means to help farmers manage this volatility and build resilience.\" Earlier, Mrs O'Neill said: \"The Northern Ireland dairy farming industry is probably in the worst condition it has ever been.\" Ulster Farmers Union president Ian Marshall also attended the meeting. He said a united front would help influence the European Commissioner Paul Hogan in attempts to get Brussels to intervene and support the price of milk \"When the unions went out and spoke to Phil Hogan a number of months ago, certainly Northern Ireland was a lone voice,\" he said. \"The landscape has changed now in that other member states are certainly applying pressure to the commissioner and we have no doubt that he's coming under immense pressure to revisit the discussion on intervention.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nAgriculture Minister Michelle O'Neill met with Environment Secretary Ms Truss in London to discuss the plight of Northern Ireland's dairy farmers.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "A", "gr", "icult", "ure", "▁Minister", "▁Mich", "elle", "▁O", "'", "Ne", "ill", "▁met", "▁with", "▁Environment", "▁Secretary", "▁M", "s", "▁Tr", "uss", "▁in", "▁London", "▁to", "▁discuss", "▁the", "▁pl", "ight", "▁of", "▁Northern", "▁Ireland", "'", "s", "▁da", "iry", "▁far", "mers", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁The", "▁", "2", "0", "1", "7", "▁C", "annes", "▁L", "ions", "▁International", "▁Festival", "▁of", "▁Cre", "ativity", "▁is", "▁a", "▁five", "▁-"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.3937653601169586, -0.5553207397460938, 0.0, -0.00024029705673456192, -0.02324637770652771, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -2.3841855067985307e-07, 0.0, 0.0, -0.3242006003856659, -0.00040141629870049655, -0.5423412322998047, -0.00015889335190877318, -0.004848983604460955, 0.0, -0.0001045410826918669, 0.0, -0.8284198045730591, -0.0006258912617340684, -0.051351312547922134, -0.0013196102809160948, -0.0006865289760753512, -0.06272006034851074, -0.0008403107640333474, -3.576278118089249e-07, -0.103939488530159, -0.004432139918208122, -0.1925969123840332, 0.0, -0.0019298041006550193, 0.0, -0.00010549465514486656, -6.90197994117625e-05, -0.45494693517684937, -0.043866708874702454, 0.0, -0.0008616310660727322, 0.0, 0.0, -3.576278118089249e-07, 0.0, 0.0, -0.09882200509309769, -0.277726411819458, -0.1957450658082962, -0.010728301480412483, -0.010200157761573792, -0.6238135695457458, -1.0516996383666992, -0.00030882356804795563, -0.05270183086395264, 0.0, -0.0001778444420779124, 0.0, -1.0728830375228426e-06, 0.0, 0.0, -1.0790574550628662, -1.127124547958374, -0.19565214216709137, -0.16435082256793976], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "A": -0.3937653601169586, "gr": -0.5553207397460938, "icult": 0.0, "ure": -0.00024029705673456192, "▁Minister": -0.02324637770652771, "▁Mich": 0.0, "elle": 0.0, "▁O": 0.0, "'": -0.1925969123840332, "Ne": 0.0, "ill": 0.0, "▁met": -0.3242006003856659, "▁with": -0.00040141629870049655, "▁Environment": -0.5423412322998047, "▁Secretary": -0.00015889335190877318, "▁M": -0.004848983604460955, "s": 0.0, "▁Tr": -0.0001045410826918669, "uss": 0.0, "▁in": -0.8284198045730591, "▁London": -0.0006258912617340684, "▁to": -0.051351312547922134, "▁discuss": -0.0013196102809160948, "▁the": -0.0006865289760753512, "▁pl": -0.06272006034851074, "ight": -0.0008403107640333474, "▁of": -1.0728830375228426e-06, "▁Northern": -0.103939488530159, "▁Ireland": -0.004432139918208122, "▁da": -0.0019298041006550193, "iry": 0.0, "▁far": -0.00010549465514486656, "mers": -6.90197994117625e-05, ".": -0.45494693517684937, "##": -0.0008616310660727322, "#": 0.0, "Art": -3.576278118089249e-07, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "▁The": -0.09882200509309769, "▁": -0.277726411819458, "2": -0.1957450658082962, "0": -0.010728301480412483, "1": -0.010200157761573792, "7": -0.6238135695457458, "▁C": -1.0516996383666992, "annes": -0.00030882356804795563, "▁L": -0.05270183086395264, "ions": 0.0, "▁International": -0.0001778444420779124, "▁Festival": 0.0, "▁Cre": 0.0, "ativity": 0.0, "▁is": -1.0790574550628662, "▁a": -1.127124547958374, "▁five": -0.19565214216709137, "▁-": -0.16435082256793976}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

They had slipped to 208-6 with Essex seamer Matt Dixon taking two wickets in two balls with figures of 4-89. But Stevens shared a partnership of 108 with James Tredwell (39) and completed his 31st first-class ton in the final over of the day at Canterbury. It was an unflappable display from the 40-year-old, who was patient at first but then showed all his attacking prowess, at one point adding 26 in the space of nine balls faced. When Tredwell was lbw to Dixon, Stevens added an unbroken 73 with Matt Coles, giving Kent four bonus points and leaving them only two short of guaranteeing second place. The score at stumps was probably a fair reflection on the way Essex bowled - a one-paced attack short of a front-line spinner. Joe Denly (74) and Sam Northeast (56) shared 109 for the third wicket, taking advantage as Essex often over-pitched. Dixon, on his return to the first team, was the pick of the attack as he swung the ball at decent pace, removing Denly and Will Gidman in successive deliveries after Ravi Bopara trapped Sam Billings lbw. The mini-collapse from 204-3 to 208-6 had Essex in the game, only for Stevens to take it away from them.

Street level democracy is in the rudest of rude health here. Which here in Walsall, really is quite rude! The saucy \"double entendre\" that's been enlivening local social media is an appropriate piece of signposting for a town where passions run deep and local politics is anything but the dreary, humdrum business of general repute. Although in fairness, we should point out that the council has now responded by repainting the offending road markings since this \"hot button\" image was recorded for posterity. For this is a town with a very acute sense of itself. Traditionally the home of the leather industry, Walsall has a football team known as the Saddlers. They are mounting a spirited challenge for promotion to the second tier of English football, the Skybet Championship. There they would rub shoulders with an assortment of local rivals including the newly-relegated star attractions, Aston Villa. At the centre of the town, is the art gallery which opened 16 years ago to widespread international acclaim. It is home to works by, among others, Jacob Epstein, Monet, Picasso, Van Gogh and Turner. No less significantly, it has provided a catalyst for the economic regeneration of the area surrounding the canal basin, like a smaller version of Birmingham's famous Gas Street. And Walsall really is like a microcosm of the political landscape of our part of the country as a whole. It's like all our famous marginals rolled into one electoral battlefield. Or is it a minefield more like? It has long been a predominantly two-party affair: the map shows the west of the town, leaning towards the rest of the Black Country, almost exclusively Labour red. While the east, inclining towards Birmingham's leafy stockbroker belt in neighbouring Four Oaks and Little Aston, is an exclusively blue Conservative preserve. And within the council, where one third of the 60 seats are up for election, the numbers reflect the changeable political weather in a region well-known for swinging back and forth between the two biggest parties. It is a significant weather vane. Labour and the Conservatives have both had long periods in over-all control. But this is a council is famous for its knife-edge outcomes producing no outright majority, with all the back room deal-making and deal-breaking that entails. A year ago the town had a minority Labour administration. But last June, the indefatigable Conservative group leader Mike Bird brokered a minority administration even though Labour have two more seats than his party. He wrestled-back the leadership of the council with the support of the three UKIP and two Independent councillors. A town that's grown accustomed to living on a political knife-edge now faces another equally cut-throat encounter. Labour's fortunes hit a notable high the last time this particular set of seats were contested four years ago, so this time round they appear to have far more to lose than to gain. They must defend nine of their 27 seats while the Conservatives defend seven of their 25.

A court heard they targeted Hussell's ex-boyfriend, who lost his job after he was wrongfully arrested. Fendall was jailed for 19 months and Hussell was sentenced to 16 months. The pair provided false information to the charity Crimestoppers, naming Hussell's former boyfriend as being responsible for a fail-to-stop collision in which another PCSO was injured. Brett Gerrity, senior crown prosecutor for CPS North West, said: \"Thomas Fendall and Jessica Hussell, who were in a personal relationship, abused their positions within the police to access restricted material on the police computer system for their own use and to settle a personal grievance. \"Fendall used the police computer system to research background information on people he and Hussell knew, and shared information and documents with others. \"They provided Crimestoppers with bogus information leading to an innocent man being investigated by the police for attempted murder.\" He continued: \"They also supplied the DVLA with fictitious intelligence, which led to the same man having his driving licence revoked. \"He had to prove he was medically fit to drive before his licence could be reinstated two months later.\" Sergeant Lee Westhead, of GMP's Serious Collision Investigation Unit, said: \"The actions of Fendall and Hussell undermine everything that is at the heart of policing in this country.\" Hussell, 19, from Glossop, and Fendall, 26, from Denton, each pleaded guilty to misconduct in a public office. They also pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice in relation to providing false information to Crimestoppers. Fendall had pleaded guilty to another count of misconduct in a public office and four counts of computer misuse relating to the GMP intelligence system.

His Etixx-Quick-Step team believe he hit a parked car, injuring the same left shoulder he dislocated during the 2014 Tour de France. Cavendish sustained bruising but no fracture or dislocation of the joint. But he will require several days of rest before being able to resume training. The crash came on the day he was named in Britain's team for this month's UCI Road World Championships, which start next weekend. But the men's road race is over a fortnight away on Sunday, 27 September, and Cavendish's team believe it is still possible he will be able to compete in the event in Virginia, the United States. Friday's sixth stage - a 192.7 km route across the Peak District National Park - was won by Cavendish's Etixx-Quick-Step team-mate Matteo Trentin. The Italian rider beat Edvald Boasson Hagen (MTN-Qhubeka) as the duo battled for the stage win. Norwegian Boasson Hagen, the 2009 Tour of Britain winner, earned enough bonus seconds to enhance his overall lead to 13 seconds ahead of the final two stages this weekend. Saturday's 227.1km seventh stage from Fakenham to Ipswich is likely to be the final chance for Boasson Hagen's rivals - chiefly Team Sky's Wout Poels - to dethrone him as Sunday's finish in central London is expected to end in a sprint. \"Stoke and Nottingham are only 50 flattish miles apart if you go via the A50; do it via Buxton, Hathersage and Bakewell and it could just break you. \"The day's victor Matteo Trentin, who has also won two Tour de France stages, said it was the hardest ride of his career. \"There may be a hint of hyberbole to that - forgiveable given the way he resisted a very elite chasing group and surged past Edvald Boasson Hagen at the death - but I cannot remember a day at the Tour of Britain when the main bunch came in 45 minutes later. \"It was a third win this week for the Etixx-Quick-Step team and it came on the day they lost their third rider, Britain's Mark Cavendish. It seems his injuries are not as serious as first feared. \"And for Boasson Hagen there is the consolation that despite Team Sky's best efforts he has almost certainly wrapped up the overall win.\" Stage 6 result 1.

A reading below 50 indicates falling output. It is the first time that activity in the sector has fallen since March 2013. Firms blamed soft domestic demand, a fall in new business from overseas and uncertainty ahead of the EU referendum. A slowdown in the oil and gas industry, a major customer for UK companies, is also hitting production. The index for new orders fell to 50.4 in April, from 51.9 the month before, matching February's three-year low. Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, said: \"On this evidence manufacturing production is now falling at a quarterly pace of around 1%, and will likely act as a drag on the economy again during the second quarter and putting greater pressure on the service sector to sustain GDP growth. \"The manufacturing labour market is also being impacted, with the data signalling close to 20,000 job losses over the past three months.\" Last week, official figures showed UK economic growth slowed to 0.4% in the first quarter of the year from 0.6% in late 2015, propped up by the services sector. David Noble, group chief executive at the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (CIPS), said: \"Recent fears over a stall in the UK's manufacturing sector have now become a reality. \"An atmosphere of deep unease is building throughout the manufacturing supply chain, eating away at new orders, reducing British exports and putting more jobs at risk. \"A sense of apprehension across the sector is being caused by enduring volatility in the oil and gas industry, falling retailer confidence and the uncertainty created by the EU referendum.\" The Markit/CIPS survey found new export orders contracted for the fourth straight month in April as the global economy continued to slow. A measure of employment in the manufacturing sector was also below the 50 mark for its fourth straight month. Lee Hopley, chief economist at the manufacturers' organisation, EEF, said: \"The sharp drop to a three-year low and another month of reported job cuts could be the clearest sign yet that referendum uncertainty is starting to weigh on the real economy. \"However, this is just another straw on the back of a sector already grappling with the struggling oil and gas sector, softening domestic demand and weak order outlook from other parts of the world, all of which are failing to provide any counterbalance to the political uncertainty at home.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nA key measure of UK manufacturing activity fell to its lowest level in three years in April, as firms blamed a slowdown in the oil and gas industry and uncertainty ahead of the EU referendum.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "A", "▁key", "▁measure", "▁of", "▁UK", "▁manufact", "uring", "▁activity", "▁fell", "▁to", "▁its", "▁lowest", "▁level", "▁in", "▁three", "▁years", "▁in", "▁April", ",", "▁as", "▁fir", "ms", "▁bl", "amed", "▁a", "▁slow", "down", "▁in", "▁the", "▁oil", "▁and", "▁gas", "▁industry", "▁and", "▁uncertainty", "▁ahead", "▁of", "▁the", "▁EU", "▁refer", "endum", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁The", "▁UK", "'", "s", "▁biggest", "▁bank", ",", "▁H", "SB", "C", ",", "▁has", "▁announced"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.66135174036026, -0.6084059476852417, -1.0104854106903076, 0.0, -0.5366756916046143, -4.470248313737102e-05, 0.0, -0.08850495517253876, -0.5064219236373901, -0.18168948590755463, -0.36090168356895447, -0.00024041623692028224, -4.7444173105759546e-05, -0.1178436428308487, -0.008100513368844986, 0.0, -0.0008509114268235862, 0.0, -0.0015625660307705402, -0.8655385971069336, -0.4040563404560089, 0.0, -0.25430020689964294, -0.00015841660206206143, -0.5356919765472412, -0.016256747767329216, -8.583032467868179e-06, 0.0, -0.00048029806930571795, -2.3841830625315197e-06, -0.0003670972364488989, 0.0, -0.004432139918208122, -0.5076255202293396, -0.01642562821507454, -0.5114044547080994, 0.0, -0.0003667397249955684, -8.368142152903602e-05, -2.3841855067985307e-07, 0.0, -0.2540851831436157, -1.597391747054644e-05, 0.0, -0.00015877417172305286, 0.0, 0.0, -1.1920928244535389e-07, 0.0, 0.0, -0.04062086343765259, -0.9743428230285645, -0.9793696403503418, 0.0, -0.1547442376613617, -0.9261098504066467, -0.11827797442674637, -0.2543282210826874, -3.576278118089249e-07, 0.0, -1.9907753085135482e-05, -0.8444445729255676, -0.10719265788793564], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "A": -0.66135174036026, "▁key": -0.6084059476852417, "▁measure": -1.0104854106903076, "▁of": 0.0, "▁UK": -0.9743428230285645, "▁manufact": -4.470248313737102e-05, "uring": 0.0, "▁activity": -0.08850495517253876, "▁fell": -0.5064219236373901, "▁to": -0.18168948590755463, "▁its": -0.36090168356895447, "▁lowest": -0.00024041623692028224, "▁level": -4.7444173105759546e-05, "▁in": 0.0, "▁three": -0.008100513368844986, "▁years": 0.0, "▁April": 0.0, ",": -1.9907753085135482e-05, "▁as": -0.8655385971069336, "▁fir": -0.4040563404560089, "ms": 0.0, "▁bl": -0.25430020689964294, "amed": -0.00015841660206206143, "▁a": -0.5356919765472412, "▁slow": -0.016256747767329216, "down": -8.583032467868179e-06, "▁the": -0.0003667397249955684, "▁oil": -2.3841830625315197e-06, "▁and": -0.5076255202293396, "▁gas": 0.0, "▁industry": -0.004432139918208122, "▁uncertainty": -0.01642562821507454, "▁ahead": -0.5114044547080994, "▁EU": -8.368142152903602e-05, "▁refer": -2.3841855067985307e-07, "endum": 0.0, ".": -0.2540851831436157, "##": -0.00015877417172305286, "#": 0.0, "Art": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "▁The": -0.04062086343765259, "'": -0.9793696403503418, "s": 0.0, "▁biggest": -0.1547442376613617, "▁bank": -0.9261098504066467, "▁H": -0.2543282210826874, "SB": -3.576278118089249e-07, "C": 0.0, "▁has": -0.8444445729255676, "▁announced": -0.10719265788793564}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

It is now alleged he raped one girl and forced himself on to another with the offences said to have taken place in Billingham and at Mr Dunlop's home from the mid-1980s to the early-1990s. He denies three counts of rape and two charges of indecent assault. On the opening day of the trial, a jury at Teesside Crown Court heard from one of the complainants who said she was raped on several occasions. She said she had been left disgusted by what had happened to her and had been unable to tell her parents. The second alleged victim described having to fight off Mr Dunlop as he tried to kiss her. Both girls were under the age of 16 at the time. Mr Dunlop's legal team told the jury the claims had been fabricated and said there were inconsistencies in the timings and dates given. The trial continues.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.01543422881513834, -0.17422449588775635, -0.00010334911348763853, -2.1576648578047752e-05, -2.622600959512056e-06, -7.152555099310121e-07, -2.3841855067985307e-07, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

In Malaysia and Singapore, people are advised to stay indoors when the haze is bad, avoid exercise and wear N95 masks - high quality protection against particles in the air. But in Kalimantan \"a lot of people do not even wear masks here because they are so used to the pollution,\" relief worker Jonathan How told the BBC. \"They've been conditioned by the haze for decades and are subjected to serious health problems much worse than in Singapore.\" This week, Mr How took a team from Singapore to Kalimantan. Their mission: to raise awareness about the dangerous air pollution and distribute 25,000 of the N95 masks. He described seeing \"smoky yellow skies\" in the region, where PSI pollutant levels have neared 2,000. Any reading over 300 is considered hazardous. The team of five arrived in Kalimantan on Monday, where they spent three days visiting local schools and hospitals to distribute masks. \"One lesson we learnt was that haze awareness is key. Though people may politely receive the N95 masks they are given, they will only use them if they truly understand the long-term health impacts of inhaling fine particulates from the haze,\" Mr How said. Singaporean photographer Edwin Koo, who also travelled with the team, documented their efforts. He shared with the BBC one experience of teaching a man how to put on a specialised N95 mask. \"When we first arrived at the airport, we gave out masks to the porters too. One of them took the strap [that were supposed to be looped over the head] and wore it on his ears, like a surgical mask. It ended up blocking his eyes and he didn't realize it was wrongly worn. So I showed him how to put it on correctly. It was then I realised that the mission was not as simple as it seemed.\" Mr Koo also said: \"Sometimes we have to cross the line of documentation. In this case, it meant that I had to put my camera down to help people put on masks and explain the hazards of exposing oneself to haze.\" Mr Koo has also been actively sharing images from the trip onto his Facebook page. His album titled, Haze Response Kalimantan 2015, features photographs of Kalimantan's burning peatlands and the daily life of the locals. Now back in Singapore, Jonathan How and the team are currently exploring new ideas on how to \"better inform people about the negative health impact of the haze\". They also want to continue to \"encourage people to use the correct masks for their protection\". \"We want to meet as many like-minded individuals and organisations as possible, to explore collaboration on longer-term solutions to the haze,\" he said. \"The regional pollution is a global responsibility, not just of the Indonesian government.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nA Singaporean team is in Indonesia to raise awareness about the dangers of the haze and distribute masks to the local population.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "A", "▁Singapore", "an", "▁team", "▁is", "▁in", "▁Indones", "ia", "▁to", "▁raise", "▁aw", "aren", "ess", "▁about", "▁the", "▁d", "angers", "▁of", "▁the", "▁ha", "ze", "▁and", "▁dist", "ribute", "▁mask", "s", "▁to", "▁the", "▁local", "▁population", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁A", "▁new", "▁study", "▁has", "▁found", "▁that", "▁the", "▁amount", "▁of", "▁time", "▁spent", "▁on", "▁social", "▁media", "▁is", "▁linked", "▁to", "▁a", "▁higher", "▁risk", "▁of", "▁de", "pression", "▁in"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.03060726635158062, -0.6656770706176758, -0.08075499534606934, -0.0069991410709917545, -0.2971474826335907, -1.1935181617736816, -0.010767810046672821, -0.00036459474358707666, -0.5065378546714783, -0.33353254199028015, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.006733347196131945, -0.0012134101707488298, -0.7606437802314758, 0.0, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -0.5447621941566467, -0.0006544832140207291, 0.0, -0.6276113390922546, -0.1181764006614685, 0.0, -0.7430211901664734, 0.0, -0.1794763058423996, -0.4203772246837616, -0.7655991911888123, -0.04597543179988861, -0.25238558650016785, -3.421248038648628e-05, 0.0, -8.821448318485636e-06, 0.0, 0.0, -8.344646857949556e-07, 0.0, 0.0, -0.07371431589126587, -0.5626950860023499, -0.08103030174970627, -0.6872590780258179, -0.0023421018850058317, -0.0008411445305682719, -0.033150814473629, -0.39420315623283386, 0.0, -0.8290069699287415, -0.2635728418827057, -0.20574277639389038, -0.010037658736109734, -3.85038583772257e-05, -0.21248601377010345, -0.03602224960923195, -0.0005529781919904053, -0.5753195881843567, -0.16700804233551025, -0.0002261144545627758, -4.768370445162873e-07, -0.00010966652916977182, 0.0, -0.5329791307449341], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "A": -0.03060726635158062, "▁Singapore": -0.6656770706176758, "an": -0.08075499534606934, "▁team": -0.0069991410709917545, "▁is": -0.21248601377010345, "▁in": -0.5329791307449341, "▁Indones": -0.010767810046672821, "ia": -0.00036459474358707666, "▁to": -0.0005529781919904053, "▁raise": -0.33353254199028015, "▁aw": 0.0, "aren": 0.0, "ess": 0.0, "▁about": -0.006733347196131945, "▁the": -0.033150814473629, "▁d": -0.7606437802314758, "angers": 0.0, "▁of": -4.768370445162873e-07, "▁ha": -0.0006544832140207291, "ze": 0.0, "▁and": -0.6276113390922546, "▁dist": -0.1181764006614685, "ribute": 0.0, "▁mask": -0.7430211901664734, "s": 0.0, "▁local": -0.7655991911888123, "▁population": -0.04597543179988861, ".": -0.25238558650016785, "##": -8.821448318485636e-06, "#": 0.0, "Art": -8.344646857949556e-07, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "▁A": -0.07371431589126587, "▁new": -0.5626950860023499, "▁study": -0.08103030174970627, "▁has": -0.6872590780258179, "▁found": -0.0023421018850058317, "▁that": -0.0008411445305682719, "▁amount": -0.39420315623283386, "▁time": -0.8290069699287415, "▁spent": -0.2635728418827057, "▁on": -0.20574277639389038, "▁social": -0.010037658736109734, "▁media": -3.85038583772257e-05, "▁linked": -0.03602224960923195, "▁a": -0.5753195881843567, "▁higher": -0.16700804233551025, "▁risk": -0.0002261144545627758, "▁de": -0.00010966652916977182, "pression": 0.0}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

The Department for Education has said it will not comment on the leaks. Birmingham council has released its own report, disagreeing with Mr Clarke. We must acknowledge today that Ian Kershaw's report shows we have serious governance issues in a small number of schools in east Birmingham because of serious malpractice by members of governing bodies. This has been compounded by the inability of head teachers and other governors to counter this behaviour and by the failure of the city council to intervene to instil proper governance. Council response in full Trojan Horse 'plot' schools timeline Reaction to 'Trojan Horse' reports The government's report was compiled by retired senior police officer Peter Clarke, the former head of the Met Police's counter-terrorism unit. It is due to be published next week. It says he found evidence of \"sustained and co-ordinated agenda to impose upon children in a number of Birmingham schools the segregationist attitudes and practices of a hardline and politicised strain of Sunni Islam\". He also found evidence of a \"co-ordinated, deliberate and sustained action to introduce an intolerant and aggressive Islamist ethos into some schools in the city\". The agenda would have confined \"schoolchildren within an intolerant, inward-looking monoculture that would severely inhibit their participation in the life of modern Britain,\" the leaked report says. A spokesman for the DfE said: \"The allegations made in relation to some schools in Birmingham are very serious and we are investigating all evidence put to us in conjunction with Ofsted and Birmingham City Council.\" Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said his union was disturbed by the Clarke review findings but not surprised. They reflected concerns raised in May about improper governance and staffing and \"a narrowing of entitlement for children\", he said. \"We do not need an over-reaction. This is not a criticism of the Islamic faith, but of a narrow current within it,\" he said. Birmingham's report, compiled by former head teacher Ian Kershaw, differed in its conclusions. It said there was \"no evidence of a conspiracy to promote an anti-British agenda, violent extremism or radicalisation in schools\" in the east of the city. Mr Kershaw did find \"key individuals\" promoting Islamic principles in schools and \"noted a pattern of these individuals moving between schools\". He did not conclude whether the original \"Trojan Horse\" letter was a hoax, as has been claimed. An unhelpful epitaph for Gove'Islam plot': Will we ever learn the truth? But he found evidence that the \"five steps\" outlined in the original letter as a means of destabilising school leadership were \"present in a large number of the schools considered part of the investigation\".

His head struck the car windscreen as he was thrown over the top of the vehicle and he is waiting to have a brain scan to see if there is any neurological injury. More on this and other Hull stories Mr Topliss-Yates said he had no chance to avoid the car and thought he was going to die. \"Literally the last thing that went through my head before I actually hit the car was to try and brace myself and try and jump on to the bonnet,\" he said. Bhamji was sentenced at Hull Magistrates' Court last week over the incident, which happened on 14 January. It was estimated he was driving at between 20mph and 30mph.

The 2016 Women's Super League One champions beat Liverpool in this year's semi-finals, while Birmingham knocked out 2015 winners Chelsea on penalties.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nThe final of the 2017 Women's Super League One will be played at Wembley Stadium on 13 May.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "The", "▁final", "▁of", "▁the", "▁", "2", "0", "1", "7", "▁Women", "'", "s", "▁Super", "▁League", "▁One", "▁will", "▁be", "▁played", "▁at", "▁W", "emble", "y", "▁Stadium", "▁on", "▁", "1", "3", "▁May", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁The", "▁", "2", "0", "1", "7", "▁World", "▁Series", "▁of", "▁P", "oker", "▁(", "WS", "OP", ")", "▁is", "▁the", "▁", "4", "8", "th", "▁annual", "▁World", "▁Series", "▁of", "▁P"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.5501019358634949, -0.6622039079666138, -0.0005824061809107661, -0.0005229535745456815, -0.37179309129714966, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.0012721073580905795, -0.023349566385149956, 0.0, 0.0, -0.11742524057626724, 0.0, -0.23174729943275452, -0.050795476883649826, -0.05270058661699295, -0.03515782952308655, -0.0009376181988045573, -1.9788545614574105e-05, 0.0, 0.0, -0.03543573245406151, -0.030718136578798294, -0.17301376163959503, 0.0, 0.0, -4.541770613286644e-05, -0.01854018121957779, -0.05305494740605354, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.04367353022098541, -0.0480961948633194, -0.1369926482439041, -0.008427887223660946, -5.507317473529838e-05, -0.02228107489645481, -0.8807694911956787, -0.2534690797328949, -0.16065503656864166, -0.00020561488054227084, 0.0, -0.069624163210392, -1.1920928244535389e-07, 0.0, -2.3841855067985307e-07, -1.1647541522979736, -0.08436957746744156, 0.0, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -0.000364713923772797, 0.0, -0.0040699755772948265, -0.00010692501382436603, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "The": -0.5501019358634949, "▁final": -0.6622039079666138, "▁of": 0.0, "▁the": -0.08436957746744156, "▁": 0.0, "2": -0.1369926482439041, "0": -0.008427887223660946, "1": -5.507317473529838e-05, "7": -0.02228107489645481, "▁Women": -0.023349566385149956, "'": 0.0, "s": 0.0, "▁Super": -0.11742524057626724, "▁League": 0.0, "▁One": -0.23174729943275452, "▁will": -0.050795476883649826, "▁be": -0.05270058661699295, "▁played": -0.03515782952308655, "▁at": -0.0009376181988045573, "▁W": -1.9788545614574105e-05, "emble": 0.0, "y": 0.0, "▁Stadium": -0.03543573245406151, "▁on": -0.030718136578798294, "3": 0.0, "▁May": -4.541770613286644e-05, ".": -0.01854018121957779, "##": 0.0, "#": 0.0, "Art": 0.0, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "▁The": -0.04367353022098541, "▁World": -0.00010692501382436603, "▁Series": 0.0, "▁P": 0.0, "oker": 0.0, "▁(": -0.069624163210392, "WS": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "OP": 0.0, ")": -2.3841855067985307e-07, "▁is": -1.1647541522979736, "4": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "8": -0.000364713923772797, "th": 0.0, "▁annual": -0.0040699755772948265}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

Officials say it is possible the number of fatalities could double. The news came as thousands marched silently through the Romanian capital in memory of the victims. People carried flowers and lit candles at a memorial outside the nightclub. Romanian President Klaus Iohannis has said safety regulations seem to have been ignored at the club. The fire broke out at about 23:00 local time (21:00 GMT) on Friday at the Colectiv club, which was hosting a free rock concert by the band Goodbye to Gravity. Up to 400 people are thought to have been inside. Survivors say the fireworks caused the ceiling and a pillar to catch fire and produce heavy smoke. A stampede for the exit followed. More than 140 people are being treated in hospital, some with severe burns. On Sunday officials said all of the dead had been identified.

One of the biggest things he did was make the players feel more confident. It wasn't magic - it was paying attention to the details His spell there brought two top-flight titles, the first in Molde's history, as well as a Norwegian Cup as he quickly established a reputation as a promising young manager. Those who know Solskjaer describe him as mild mannered and gentle, with a knack for getting the best out of players and a desire to play attacking football. They also call him tough-minded and ambitious. But how will a manager used to \"complete control\" of team affairs fare in one of Europe's most unforgiving leagues and under one of the Premier League's more controversial owners in Malaysian businessman Vincent Tan? \"He showed he is a good manager in the short time he was here at Molde,\" says the club's Norway international goalkeeper Espen Bugge Pettersen. \"There is no reason why he should not be successful. \"He probably has not changed a lot since his playing days. He is a mild and gentle guy but when it is needed he can put his foot down. \"You won't find anyone who has a bad word to say about him, because they don't exist. He isn't afraid of making the tough decisions but he does it the right way and if he is not satisfied he will let you know.\" Solskjaer, scorer of Manchester United's injury-time winner in their 1999 Champions League final triumph over Bayern Munich, ended his 11-year playing career at Old Trafford with six Premier League titles and two FA Cups to add to that Champions League winners' medal. Injuries disrupted his final few years as a player and he was then offered a coaching role at the club by Sir Alex Ferguson, where as reserve team boss he won the Manchester Senior Cup, the Lancashire Senior Cup and the Premier League reserve play-offs. \"Ole always wanted to stay in the game, so from an early age he was preparing to stay in the game as a coach or as a manager,\" Ferguson told the Manchester Evening News in 2012. \"He was always one of the professionals who used to take down all the notes from the training sessions and games. He has got an inner toughness, there's no doubt about that.\" Given his first senior managerial role at Molde in 2011, Solskjaer delivered instant success at the club from which Manchester United had signed him in 1996. A first Tippeligaen title in the club's 100-year history arrived in his first season, breaking the dominance of Rosenberg, who had won 16 of the previous 19 championships, followed by a successful title defence and then the Norwegian Cup in November. \"Molde is a small place with 25,000 to 30,000 people,\" says Jonas Bergh-Johnsen, a journalist for Norwegian TV channel TV2. \"It is small\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer has been a successful manager in Norway and is now attempting to make an impact in the Premier League at Cardiff City.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "O", "le", "▁G", "unn", "ar", "▁Sol", "sk", "ja", "er", "▁has", "▁been", "▁a", "▁successful", "▁manager", "▁in", "▁Norway", "▁and", "▁is", "▁now", "▁attempting", "▁to", "▁make", "▁an", "▁impact", "▁in", "▁the", "▁Premier", "▁League", "▁at", "▁Card", "iff", "▁City", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁The", "▁", "2", "0", "1", "7", "▁Nobel", "▁Prize", "▁in", "▁Physics", "▁was", "▁awarded", "▁to", "▁three", "▁scient", "ists", "▁for", "▁their", "▁work", "▁on", "▁the", "▁most"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.043296992778778076, 0.0, -5.602820692729438e-06, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.38929876685142517, -0.19056324660778046, -0.8801206946372986, -0.6966403722763062, -0.013710963539779186, -0.02842726744711399, -0.003288221312686801, -0.4183288514614105, -0.13060642778873444, -0.00011252723925281316, -0.5181618928909302, -8.344646857949556e-07, -2.47952248173533e-05, -0.00038485272671096027, 0.0, -0.25987792015075684, -0.0008397151832468808, -2.6225699912174605e-05, 0.0, -0.5076737403869629, 0.0, 0.0, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -0.044982943683862686, -0.0018441352294757962, 0.0, -8.583032467868179e-06, 0.0, 0.0, -8.344646857949556e-07, 0.0, 0.0, -0.08147355169057846, -0.2306307852268219, -0.1613745242357254, -0.09496746957302094, -0.00330414273776114, -0.3308790624141693, -0.19821800291538239, -4.6967357775429264e-05, -0.0008386432309634984, -0.6377711892127991, -0.11745576560497284, -1.2636104656849056e-05, -0.054608847945928574, -0.010646567679941654, -0.029655758291482925, 0.0, -0.25961267948150635, -0.0009739422821439803, -0.0010824303608387709, -0.17331653833389282, -0.04764005169272423, -0.4902239739894867], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "O": -0.043296992778778076, "le": 0.0, "▁G": -5.602820692729438e-06, "unn": 0.0, "ar": 0.0, "▁Sol": 0.0, "sk": 0.0, "ja": 0.0, "er": 0.0, "▁has": -0.38929876685142517, "▁been": -0.19056324660778046, "▁a": -0.8801206946372986, "▁successful": -0.6966403722763062, "▁manager": -0.013710963539779186, "▁in": -0.0008386432309634984, "▁Norway": -0.003288221312686801, "▁and": -0.4183288514614105, "▁is": -0.13060642778873444, "▁now": -0.00011252723925281316, "▁attempting": -0.5181618928909302, "▁to": -0.054608847945928574, "▁make": -2.47952248173533e-05, "▁an": -0.00038485272671096027, "▁impact": 0.0, "▁the": -0.04764005169272423, "▁Premier": -2.6225699912174605e-05, "▁League": 0.0, "▁at": -0.5076737403869629, "▁Card": 0.0, "iff": 0.0, "▁City": -1.1920928244535389e-07, ".": -0.044982943683862686, "##": -8.583032467868179e-06, "#": 0.0, "Art": -8.344646857949556e-07, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "▁The": -0.08147355169057846, "▁": -0.2306307852268219, "2": -0.1613745242357254, "0": -0.09496746957302094, "1": -0.00330414273776114, "7": -0.3308790624141693, "▁Nobel": -0.19821800291538239, "▁Prize": -4.6967357775429264e-05, "▁Physics": -0.6377711892127991, "▁was": -0.11745576560497284, "▁awarded": -1.2636104656849056e-05, "▁three": -0.010646567679941654, "▁scient": -0.029655758291482925, "ists": 0.0, "▁for": -0.25961267948150635, "▁their": -0.0009739422821439803, "▁work": -0.0010824303608387709, "▁on": -0.17331653833389282, "▁most": -0.4902239739894867}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

Strong demand for its Playstation 4 console and games led to an 11.8% jump in sales for Sony's Game and Network Services division. That helped to offset a 20% plunge in smartphone sales. Sony's Pictures segment - which covers films and television programmes - saw a 6.8% jump in annual sales. The boost came partly from higher subscription video-on-demand revenues for television series such as Breaking Bad, The Blacklist and Better Call Saul. Sony +11.8% PS4 hardware & software +10.4% Music +6.8% Pictures -20% Mobile Communications Sony did not offer a forecast on future performance, as it is still assessing the impact from this month's twin earthquakes which took place in south-west Japan and affected Sony's supply chain. The region where the earthquake struck - Kumamoto - is a manufacturing hub for many Japanese companies, including Sony and carmakers Toyota and Honda. Sony said, \"With aftershocks continuing and employee safety the foremost priority, inspections of the facility and the development of a recovery plan remain ongoing.\" The Kumamoto Technology Center is the main manufacturing site of image sensors for the firm's digital and security cameras, as well as micro-display devices. Last year, Sony decided to spin off its video-and-audio business into a separate company as part of a three-year plan to return to profit. Chief executive Kazuo Hirai said the company must not be afraid to change if it hoped \"to grow in a Sony-like way\". He said the Japanese electronics firm would no longer pursue sales growth in areas such as smartphones where it has suffered competition from rivals Apple and Samsung.

The former Manchester United stars put the project on hold following criticism from conservationists. Historic England said the plan was \"getting there\". The revised proposals had the potential to \"enhance\" the area's character \"rather than dominate it\", it said. The public body said the previous scheme threatened to \"erase\" the area's history. The St Michael's development plan includes a five-star hotel, apartments, offices and a synagogue. Neville said the scheme would make a \"significant contribution\" to the growth of Manchester city centre and create 1,500 jobs. He said they had not shied away from the \"passionate debate\" on the original proposals and addressed the issues raised \"head-on\". \"At the same time, we have kept faith with our central vision of creating a true mixed-use destination with a signature development of the highest quality including residential living, Grade A offices, a five-star hotel, exciting retail and leisure units and world-class outdoor spaces,\" he said. Work could start by spring or early summer 2018, subject to planning approval, he added. The plans still include a new synagogue and a public square outside the Sir Ralph Abercromby, the developers said. Catherine Dewar, from Historic England, said: \"The new masterplan still needs work but it's getting there. \"The new proposals... have the potential to enhance the character of the Deansgate/Peter Street conservation area, rather than dominate it, as the previous scheme threatened.\" Ms Dewar said the change to the plan for a single tower further away from the town hall and twisted around would have much less impact on the Grade II-listed Central Library, Grade I-listed Town Hall and Grade I-listed St. Ann's Church. The former police headquarters and the Sir Ralph Abercromby pub \"have soul and tell important stories about our city's past\", she added.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nA public consultation has opened on the new proposals for a single tower rather than two skyscrapers for the Jackson's Row area of the city.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "A", "▁public", "▁consult", "ation", "▁has", "▁opened", "▁on", "▁the", "▁new", "▁propos", "als", "▁for", "▁a", "▁single", "▁tower", "▁rather", "▁than", "▁two", "▁sk", "ys", "c", "rap", "ers", "▁for", "▁the", "▁Jackson", "'", "s", "▁Row", "▁area", "▁of", "▁the", "▁city", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁The", "▁new", "▁propos", "als", "▁for", "▁the", "▁Jackson", "'", "s", "▁Row", "▁area", "▁of", "▁Manchester", "▁city", "▁centre", "▁include", "▁a", "▁single", "▁tower", "▁rather", "▁than"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.10953084379434586, -0.05066392198204994, 0.0, 0.0, -0.002438430907204747, -9.536738616588991e-07, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -0.8092131018638611, -0.015399716794490814, -4.5536911784438416e-05, 0.0, -0.2519384026527405, -0.3720177114009857, -0.480268269777298, -0.07896465808153152, -0.7429280877113342, 0.0, -3.576278118089249e-07, -7.152555099310121e-07, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.4530005156993866, -0.00033241944038309157, -7.152555099310121e-07, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -3.6954811548639555e-06, -0.035052284598350525, 0.0, -0.40133363008499146, -0.6464097499847412, 0.0, -1.6689286894688848e-06, 0.0, 0.0, -2.3841855067985307e-07, 0.0, 0.0, -0.17547957599163055, -0.38821467757225037, -0.10305625200271606, 0.0, -0.38820451498031616, -0.2554577589035034, -0.0006281548412516713, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -1.4066597032069694e-05, -0.0013558013597503304, -0.03505251556634903, -0.255067378282547, -1.6689286894688848e-06, -0.01951763406395912, -1.1920922133867862e-06, -0.010634773410856724, -1.3351351299206726e-05, -0.0009334497735835612, 0.0], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "A": -0.10953084379434586, "▁public": -0.05066392198204994, "▁consult": 0.0, "ation": 0.0, "▁has": -0.002438430907204747, "▁opened": -9.536738616588991e-07, "▁on": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "▁the": -0.2554577589035034, "▁new": -0.38821467757225037, "▁propos": -0.10305625200271606, "als": 0.0, "▁for": -0.38820451498031616, "▁a": -1.1920922133867862e-06, "▁single": -0.010634773410856724, "▁tower": -1.3351351299206726e-05, "▁rather": -0.0009334497735835612, "▁than": 0.0, "▁two": -3.576278118089249e-07, "▁sk": -7.152555099310121e-07, "ys": 0.0, "c": 0.0, "rap": 0.0, "ers": 0.0, "▁Jackson": -0.0006281548412516713, "'": 0.0, "s": 0.0, "▁Row": 0.0, "▁area": -1.4066597032069694e-05, "▁of": -0.0013558013597503304, "▁city": -0.255067378282547, ".": -0.40133363008499146, "##": -1.6689286894688848e-06, "#": 0.0, "Art": -2.3841855067985307e-07, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "▁The": -0.17547957599163055, "▁Manchester": -0.03505251556634903, "▁centre": -1.6689286894688848e-06, "▁include": -0.01951763406395912}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

Andrew Braddock, from trade body UK Tram, said the accident should be \"set in the context of an extremely safe mode of transport\". \"You are 15 times safer travelling on a tram than you would be in a bus, 24 times safer than you would be in a car,\" he said. \"We had a dreadful incident in Croydon yesterday, there's absolutely no getting away from that, but it's extremely rare.\" British Transport Police are investigating whether the Croydon tram was exceeding speed limits and the possibility the driver may have fallen asleep or blacked out. The crash is believed to be the first involving fatalities on board a tram in the UK since 1959, when two women passengers and the driver died when a tram caught fire in Glasgow after a collision with a lorry. Deaths from tram derailments are rare around the world. Several people died and around 50 were injured when a tram overturned in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil in August 2011, while around 30 were killed and 50 injured when a tram derailed in eastern Ukraine in July 1996. Trams were phased out in the UK at the end of 1962 with the closure of the Glasgow network, leaving Blackpool's as the only one running. A new generation of tramways began with the opening of the Manchester Metrolink in 1992, and there are now also networks in Sheffield, Birmingham, London, Nottingham and Edinburgh, and about 300 worldwide. There were no trams in London between 1952 and 2000, when the London Tramlink opened. Mr Braddock described trams as being like a \"bus on rails\", travelling at similar speeds and peaking in cities at about 50mph. Powered by electricity through overhead wires, drivers control the vehicle using a lever - usually with their left hand - pushing forward to accelerate, backwards to brake and with a neutral stopping point in the middle. But unlike trains, trams are not fitted with systems that apply brakes automatically if they are going too fast or jump a light. The key safety feature is a vigilance device, known in the railway industry as the \"dead man's lever\" - a device that brakes automatically if the driver is incapacitated. Mr Braddock said: \"On the tram control lever there is a button which the driver presses at least every 30 seconds. If that button is not pressed the brakes are applied automatically. \"It makes no difference if the driver is powering up or braking, he has to keep pressing that button.

The City Deal scheme will see eight council areas around Glasgow receive about £1bn from the UK and Scottish governments. The councils also have the power to borrow extra cash. The Glasgow and Clyde Valley City Deal involved massive investment by both the Scottish and UK governments last year. Eight councils - Glasgow, East Renfrewshire, Renfrewshire, Inverclyde, North and South Lanarkshire and East and West Dunbartonshire - are involved. The City Deal scheme will see Westminster and Holyrood give £500m each in additional grant funding to the eight council areas. The councils will supplement this by borrowing £130m. Councillors from across all eight areas will meet to discuss some of the schemes. Several of the projects being discussed later are in East Renfrewshire, where £44m is expected to be invested over the next few years, with much of the money coming from the City Deal funding. One is a water sports park at the Dams to Darnley Country Park. It would open in 2017 and include a centre offering wakeboarding, the fastest-growing extreme sport in the world. A new railway station in Barrhead and sliproad from the M77 would serve an area which could become one of East Renfrewshire's fastest growth areas. The council expects 1,000 new homes to be built there. Another project would transform the Levern Works site in Barrhead. A site formerly occupied by Nestle, where pet food was once made, would be cleared. The site will then be marketed for development for a range of uses that will bring new jobs to Barrhead.

One survivors' group said it was \"indicative of a crisis\" in the inquiry which is examining allegations of child abuse in residential accommodation. Andi Lavery, spokesman for the survivors' group White Flowers Alba, said victims were rapidly losing confidence in the inquiry's credibility. And Alan Draper, from In Care Abuse Survivors, said survivors were \"at a loss\" to understand what was happening. He told BBC Scotland: \"There is concern that the inquiry is dominated by the legal profession, without any balance from other professional groups who have a detailed knowledge of child abuse and its impact and implications for survivors and their families. \"Survivors are considering withdrawing from this whole process until they are satisfied that survivors are placed at the centre of the inquiry. \"The inquiry is about what happened to them and the failure of the establishment to protect them from harm. This failure is continuing.\" The probe is due to report in late 2019. Mr Houston said a \"change in priorities\" in his working life meant he had applied for positions at the Northern Health and Social Care Trust and the Disclosure and Barring Service. \"I have now been successful in those applications and the appointments have been made,\" he said. \"Lady Smith and I have discussed the potential that at some future time, a perception of conflict of interest may arise between these appointments and my work as a panel member on the Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry. \"After careful consideration of both the time commitment required to fulfil these new roles and the potential, however small, for perceptions to arise of conflict of interest, I have tendered my resignation to the inquiry.\" Mr Houston added that he had been \"honoured\" to be appointed to the panel. Deputy First Minister John Swinney said he had accepted the resignation of Mr Houston and thanked him for his positive contribution. \"I know this was not an easy decision for him to reach, but he can be very proud of the contribution he has made to the establishment of the Child Abuse Inquiry and to ensuring its continuing progress,\" he said. In July 2016, senior judge Lady Smith was appointed as the new chairwoman of the inquiry following Ms O'Brien's resignation. A successor to Mr Houston will not be appointed to the inquiry so Lady Smith will continue as the sole panel member. The Scottish government said this brought it in line with other public inquiries established in Scotland under the 2005 Inquiries Act. The abuse inquiry has been plagued by problems since it was set up in October 2015. More than Â£3.5m has been spent on it during this period. Prof Lamb resigned in June 2016 claiming the inquiry was \"doomed\". Ms O'Brien stood down days later after being told she faced the sack over \"unacceptable\" comments about child sex abuse victims.

The monocle has a reserve price of £500 - £800 and the xylophone £1,500 - £2,000.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\nSir Patrick Moore's famous monocle and his xylophone are due to be sold at two separate auctions.\n\n###\nArticle: As Nadir Ciftci sloped off to Eskisehirspor on loan, fellow forward Colin Kazim-Richards, formerly of Fenerbahce and Galatasaray, arrived from Feyenoord just as his suspension for threatening a journalist came to an end. Whether or not either Turk will delight enough to be hits with their new clubs, it is another loanee who has the potential to set Celtic Park alight if he lives up to his market value. Patrick Roberts moved to Manchester City in the summer for about £12m and the 18-year-old winger has 18 months with the reigning Scottish champions in which to prove himself worthy of the fee paid to Fulham. Kazim-Richards is perhaps even more of a gamble, not only because of his off-field antics but also for a lack of career goals, and steady Erik Sviatchenko is maybe a safer bet to prove worthy of the £1.5m Celtic paid Midtjylland for the Denmark defender. Celtic might need to squeeze every last pound of value out of their new arrivals to thwart a sustained Aberdeen title challenge that appears to have surprised even those inside Pittodrie. The Dandies' deadline-day signing of Simon Church on loan from MK Dons means they have a striker hungry for goals to ensure his place in Wales' Euro 2016 finals squad. However, the Dons may live to regret their bungled attempt to sign Greg Tansey from Inverness Caledonian Thistle in events that left them minus the additional cover in central midfield manager Derek McInnes thought necessary. While they brought in two replacements, the recall by Liverpool of promising goalkeeper Danny Ward could also prove costly in the long run. Third-top Hearts made the biggest profit during January as they arranged a deal that should mean they pocket more than £1m for the sale of Osman Sow to Henan Jianye, who also bought Ryan McGowan from Dundee United, as the Chinese Super League begins to flex its financial muscle. The Edinburgh club have replaced the Swede with Abiola Dauda, a Nigerian striker on loan from Vitesse who has an even more impressive scoring record. Elsewhere, there was the usual influx and exchange of journeymen pros, with Dundee United failing to make the kind of exciting acquisitions that will transform their fans' hopes into expectation that they can bridge the gaping points gap at the bottom of the table.

The Australian Broadcasting Corp. quoted Sophia's grandmother, Vera Cook, who credited the dog with saving the toddler's life.

He managed to haul three elderly passengers out of the water from the boat just before it sank. His father, Ian Watmore, said the catamaran had \"just ploughed straight into the boat and ripped it in half\". \"They saw it and just assumed it was going to go round them and, when they realised it was coming straight at them, they started yelling and screaming but nothing changed,\" he said. \"These catamarans are quite powerful and the blade just ripped the thing in half.\" Watmore had been in Barbados in February, recovering from an operation on a cruciate knee ligament injury, when the crash happened. One of the guests on the boat had just had a hip replacement, one could not swim and the other was over 80, his father said. After the crash, his son \"clambered up on to the catamaran\" and lifted them, and the skipper, out of the water just as their fishing boat sank, he said. The 23-year-old footballer used his T-shirt as a tourniquet for the woman's leg, which was \"bleeding heavily\". It was only afterwards that \"shock started to set in\", Mr Watmore Snr said. \"All the guests were coming up to him and telling him what a hero he was and I think the whole thing was just very disorientating for him,\" he said. The rescue had been a good test of the strength of his knee, though \"not one you'd plan\", he added. It is not known how the catamaran came to hit the fishing boat but it is believed its skipper was taken away by police.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nA fishing boat was hit by a catamaran in Barbados, and the fishing boat sank.  \n\n[INST] Write a title for this article: The 100-year-old man who climbed out the window and disappeared [/INST]\n\nThe ", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "A", "▁fish", "ing", "▁boat", "▁was", "▁hit", "▁by", "▁a", "▁cat", "amar", "an", "▁in", "▁Barb", "ados", ",", "▁and", "▁the", "▁fish", "ing", "▁boat", "▁s", "ank", ".", "▁▁", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "[", "INST", "]", "▁Write", "▁a", "▁title", "▁for", "▁this", "▁article", ":", "▁The", "▁", "1", "0", "0", "-", "year", "-", "old", "▁man", "▁who", "▁clim", "bed", "▁out", "▁the", "▁window", "▁and", "▁disappeared", "▁[", "/", "INST", "]", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "The", "▁", "1"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.0009117737063206732, -0.03230837732553482, -0.00292397802695632, -0.00015841660206206143, -0.27064579725265503, -0.0005650115781463683, -0.07895386219024658, -5.602820692729438e-06, -0.0008783058729022741, 0.0, 0.0, -0.0075629339553415775, -0.0001070442158379592, 0.0, -0.3642279803752899, -0.04810959845781326, -0.005547722801566124, -0.5796977877616882, -0.0016370717203244567, 0.0, -0.1498556286096573, -0.0008386432309634984, -0.05592307820916176, -0.24251963198184967, -3.099436753473128e-06, 0.0, -0.004455757327377796, 0.0, 0.0, -0.4702012836933136, -0.010304110124707222, -0.0003885467885993421, -2.3841855067985307e-07, -8.583032467868179e-06, -4.529942543740617e-06, 0.0, -0.19701151549816132, -0.3397071659564972, -0.2623708248138428, -0.2890602648258209, -0.3764343559741974, -0.2726082503795624, -0.008190732449293137, -2.0265558760002023e-06, 0.0, -0.22451390326023102, -2.098061486321967e-05, -0.0073272306472063065, 0.0, -0.4518369436264038, -0.010172544978559017, -4.768370445162873e-07, -0.010185525752604008, -4.768370445162873e-07, -0.0635976791381836, -1.2993727978027891e-05, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.030731430277228355, -1.4662635294371285e-05, 0.0], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "A": -0.0009117737063206732, "▁fish": -0.5796977877616882, "ing": -0.0016370717203244567, "▁boat": 0.0, "▁was": -0.27064579725265503, "▁hit": -0.0005650115781463683, "▁by": -0.07895386219024658, "▁a": -0.010304110124707222, "▁cat": -0.0008783058729022741, "amar": 0.0, "an": 0.0, "▁in": -0.0075629339553415775, "▁Barb": -0.0001070442158379592, "ados": 0.0, ",": -0.3642279803752899, "▁and": -0.010185525752604008, "▁the": -0.010172544978559017, "▁s": -0.1498556286096573, "ank": -0.0008386432309634984, ".": -0.05592307820916176, "▁▁": -0.24251963198184967, "[": -0.004455757327377796, "INST": 0.0, "]": 0.0, "▁Write": -0.4702012836933136, "▁title": -0.0003885467885993421, "▁for": -2.3841855067985307e-07, "▁this": -8.583032467868179e-06, "▁article": -4.529942543740617e-06, ":": 0.0, "▁The": -0.19701151549816132, "▁": -1.4662635294371285e-05, "1": 0.0, "0": -0.3764343559741974, "-": -2.0265558760002023e-06, "year": -0.008190732449293137, "old": 0.0, "▁man": -0.22451390326023102, "▁who": -2.098061486321967e-05, "▁clim": -0.0073272306472063065, "bed": 0.0, "▁out": -0.4518369436264038, "▁window": -4.768370445162873e-07, "▁disappeared": -4.768370445162873e-07, "▁[": -0.0635976791381836, "/": -1.2993727978027891e-05, "The": -0.030731430277228355}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

Nursing is not on the Shortage Occupation List, giving priority to migrants with specific qualifications. UK ministers said they took independent advice on the list and the long-term aim was to \"train our own nurses\". Health Minister Mark Drakeford said: \"We have argued in favour of including nursing on the list. It seems essential to me. It is just a wrongheaded focus on the wrong issue that is leading them to refuse to do that. I've argued as well for a separate Welsh Shortage Occupation List.\" Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital Trust, which serves mid Wales patients, could not recruit the nurses because it had been unable to get certificates of sponsorship from the Home Office, according to the email. Trust Communications director Adrian Osborne sent the message to MPs and AMs in mid Wales, Shropshire and Telford & Wrekin. He wrote: \"Alongside our local recruitment and training programmes, we had also implemented an international recruitment programme focused on the Philippines. \"This has faced delays as we have not been successful in securing Certificates of Sponsorship from the Home Office to bring these nurses to our wards. \"This is because nursing is neither on the Shortage Occupation List, nor do these posts secure enough points for them to be a priority for the Migration Advisory Committee.\" Lib Dem AM William Powell has written to the UK government calling for a change to the policy. \"The Tories' irresponsible and illogical attitude to immigration is contributing to an NHS staffing crisis in Wales,\" he said. \"What kind of government wants to stop vitally needed nurses coming to work in our country? This is reckless in the extreme. \"Of course we need to be training nurses in this country and we need a clear strategy to train our workforce for the future, but patients need support now, not in ten years' time.\" In a letter to Mr Powell, Immigration Minister James Brokenshire said: \"The UK government believes that in the past it has been too easy for employers to bring in workers from overseas rather than take the long-term decision to train our workforce here at home. \"The long-term aim is that we train our own nurses in this country. \"A number of health professional jobs, such as doctors in emergency medicine, are recognised shortage occupations, but the Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) recently recommended against adding nurses to the Shortage Occupation List.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nA Welsh hospital trust has been unable to recruit foreign nurses because the Home Office has not issued the necessary visas.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "A", "▁Wel", "sh", "▁hospital", "▁trust", "▁has", "▁been", "▁unable", "▁to", "▁rec", "ruit", "▁foreign", "▁n", "urs", "es", "▁because", "▁the", "▁Home", "▁Office", "▁has", "▁not", "▁issued", "▁the", "▁necessary", "▁vis", "as", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁The", "▁government", "▁has", "▁launched", "▁a", "▁new", "▁scheme", "▁to", "▁help", "▁the", "▁UK", "'", "s", "▁poor", "est", "▁families", "▁with", "▁the", "▁cost", "▁of", "▁school", "▁uniform", "s", ".", "▁The", "▁£", "3", "m"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.039881382137537, -0.11872228235006332, 0.0, -0.0008033862104639411, -0.00037496211007237434, -0.301628440618515, -0.13705500960350037, -0.00031513971043750644, 0.0, -0.00048339602653868496, 0.0, -0.697476327419281, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.0004781533498317003, -0.4015732407569885, -0.0069540380500257015, 0.0, -0.07651736587285995, -0.5108461976051331, -0.18700458109378815, -0.5367900133132935, -0.004613351076841354, -0.2962733209133148, -0.0019286142196506262, -0.08170614391565323, -0.0013181816320866346, 0.0, -0.00015937011630740017, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.25580671429634094, -0.4751874804496765, -0.529381275177002, -0.7963361144065857, -0.0029778205789625645, -0.29940447211265564, -0.45665913820266724, -0.0004612335760612041, -0.010900122113525867, -0.499235063791275, -0.11091018468141556, -0.005000940524041653, 0.0, -0.6161969900131226, 0.0, -0.7033630609512329, -0.23090988397598267, -0.02308948151767254, -0.0019490785198286176, 0.0, -0.5093729496002197, -0.00024148885859176517, -3.576278118089249e-07, -0.1545962542295456, -0.005466394126415253, -0.777110755443573, -0.11513595283031464, -0.07989495247602463], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "A": -0.039881382137537, "▁Wel": -0.11872228235006332, "sh": 0.0, "▁hospital": -0.0008033862104639411, "▁trust": -0.00037496211007237434, "▁has": -0.529381275177002, "▁been": -0.13705500960350037, "▁unable": -0.00031513971043750644, "▁to": -0.0004612335760612041, "▁rec": -0.00048339602653868496, "ruit": 0.0, "▁foreign": -0.697476327419281, "▁n": 0.0, "urs": 0.0, "es": 0.0, "▁because": -0.0004781533498317003, "▁the": -0.02308948151767254, "▁Home": -0.0069540380500257015, "▁Office": 0.0, "▁not": -0.5108461976051331, "▁issued": -0.18700458109378815, "▁necessary": -0.004613351076841354, "▁vis": -0.2962733209133148, "as": -0.0019286142196506262, ".": -0.1545962542295456, "##": -0.00015937011630740017, "#": 0.0, "Art": 0.0, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "▁The": -0.005466394126415253, "▁government": -0.4751874804496765, "▁launched": -0.7963361144065857, "▁a": -0.0029778205789625645, "▁new": -0.29940447211265564, "▁scheme": -0.45665913820266724, "▁help": -0.010900122113525867, "▁UK": -0.11091018468141556, "'": -0.005000940524041653, "s": -3.576278118089249e-07, "▁poor": -0.6161969900131226, "est": 0.0, "▁families": -0.7033630609512329, "▁with": -0.23090988397598267, "▁cost": -0.0019490785198286176, "▁of": 0.0, "▁school": -0.5093729496002197, "▁uniform": -0.00024148885859176517, "▁£": -0.777110755443573, "3": -0.11513595283031464, "m": -0.07989495247602463}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

The men needed regular visits because they could suffer a relapse which could put the public at risk. Ms Doherty denied any wrongdoing but three allegations were found proven. A fourth charge of acting \"dishonestly\" was found not proven. The hearing was told Ms Doherty worked for Vale of Glamorgan council as a senior social worker and had years of experience. Part of her job was to make sure people who had committed \"significant crimes\" but were living in the community, complied with Crown Court orders issued under the Mental Health Act. Ms Doherty said visits had happened every six weeks but council mental health services manager Andrew Cole, giving evidence on the first of a two-day hearing, said the visits were less frequent. \"[This led] to a potential increased risk of somebody's mental health deteriorating and an escalation in their behaviour - which is more likely to go undetected,\" he said. Mr Cole also said the minimum four-week frequency of visits was set by doctors and would have been \"clearly marked\" on official documents. In her evidence, Ms Doherty told the panel she often had an excessive work-load, inadequate management support and often felt \"left out on a limb\". The hearing was also told that bereavement had caused her to \"burn out\" and that her life had become \"chaotic\" as a result. Ms Doherty, who had been subject to a suspension order since the allegations came to light in 2014, told the hearing she was not seeking to return to social care. A report by the care watchdog said: \"The committee finds that only a Removal Order will be adequate in this case given the seriousness of the impairment.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nA social worker accused of failing to visit four men on the sex offenders register has been suspended.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "A", "▁social", "▁worker", "▁accused", "▁of", "▁failing", "▁to", "▁visit", "▁four", "▁men", "▁on", "▁the", "▁sex", "▁off", "enders", "▁register", "▁has", "▁been", "▁susp", "ended", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁The", "▁", "1", "9", "-", "year", "-", "old", "▁man", "▁was", "▁arrested", "▁on", "▁susp", "icion", "▁of", "▁murder", "▁and", "▁was", "▁taken", "▁to", "▁a", "▁police", "▁station", "▁in", "▁south", "▁London", ",", "▁where", "▁he", "▁was", "▁question", "ed", "▁by", "▁officers"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -8.523101132595912e-05, -0.005311781074851751, 0.0, -0.9735171794891357, 0.0, -0.03592588007450104, -0.00024041623692028224, -0.0597897507250309, -0.596227765083313, -0.12143877148628235, -0.8292656540870667, -0.00459400936961174, -0.25247079133987427, -1.0728830375228426e-06, -0.0008386432309634984, -0.015391030348837376, -0.4582885503768921, -0.056866373866796494, -0.09256136417388916, 0.0, -1.0148048400878906, -0.007565063424408436, 0.0, -3.6954811548639555e-06, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.14579588174819946, -0.35157349705696106, -0.2924230992794037, -0.14917205274105072, -0.7114418148994446, -2.50339189733495e-06, -8.940656698541716e-06, 0.0, -0.21725408732891083, -0.11184662580490112, -0.25777074694633484, -0.6349847316741943, -0.003907190170139074, 0.0, 0.0, -0.17640025913715363, -0.17479318380355835, -1.0419273376464844, -0.14006415009498596, -0.006716177798807621, -0.00024434918304905295, -0.0006064721383154392, 0.0, -0.26404502987861633, -0.024549992755055428, -0.003399191191419959, -0.6414187550544739, -0.00563935749232769, -0.0002643712505232543, -0.003329687984660268, -0.17398792505264282, 0.0, -0.059346217662096024, -0.035416632890701294], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "A": -8.523101132595912e-05, "▁social": -0.005311781074851751, "▁worker": 0.0, "▁accused": -0.9735171794891357, "▁of": 0.0, "▁failing": -0.03592588007450104, "▁to": -0.006716177798807621, "▁visit": -0.0597897507250309, "▁four": -0.596227765083313, "▁men": -0.12143877148628235, "▁on": -0.6349847316741943, "▁the": -0.00459400936961174, "▁sex": -0.25247079133987427, "▁off": -1.0728830375228426e-06, "enders": -0.0008386432309634984, "▁register": -0.015391030348837376, "▁has": -0.4582885503768921, "▁been": -0.056866373866796494, "▁susp": -0.003907190170139074, "ended": 0.0, ".": -1.0148048400878906, "##": -3.6954811548639555e-06, "#": 0.0, "Art": 0.0, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "▁The": -0.14579588174819946, "▁": -0.35157349705696106, "1": -0.2924230992794037, "9": -0.14917205274105072, "-": -8.940656698541716e-06, "year": -2.50339189733495e-06, "old": 0.0, "▁man": -0.21725408732891083, "▁was": -0.003329687984660268, "▁arrested": -0.25777074694633484, "icion": 0.0, "▁murder": -0.17640025913715363, "▁and": -0.17479318380355835, "▁taken": -0.14006415009498596, "▁a": -0.00024434918304905295, "▁police": -0.0006064721383154392, "▁station": 0.0, "▁in": -0.26404502987861633, "▁south": -0.024549992755055428, "▁London": -0.003399191191419959, ",": -0.6414187550544739, "▁where": -0.00563935749232769, "▁he": -0.0002643712505232543, "▁question": -0.17398792505264282, "ed": 0.0, "▁by": -0.059346217662096024, "▁officers": -0.035416632890701294}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

Migrants from the US, Australia and South Africa were found to earn much more than the UK-born population. By contrast, people from Pakistan and Bangladesh tended to earn much less, the research suggested. The study used data from the official Labour Force Survey of 100,000 people. It suggests: It also suggests that more migrants than UK-born people claim housing benefit, tax credits and child benefit. However, claims for Income Support and Jobseeker's Allowance differ little between migrants and UK-born people. Migrant claims were noticeably lower for sickness and disability benefits and carers' allowances, the study suggests. MigrationWatch chairman, Lord Green of Deddington, said the analysis showed that the argument that all immigration to the UK was beneficial could not possibly be right. He said any sensible policy should take account of the real differences in economic characteristics between migrants from different parts of the world. \"If immigration policy has been intended to attract only 'the brightest and the best' it has clearly failed, with a very large number of migrants earning less or claiming more than the British-born,\" he added. \"The clear message of this research is that immigration can be reduced substantially while permitting entry to those migrants that our economy really needs.\" The effect migrants have on a host economy depends on their skills, those of workers in the host country and other factors including rules relating to employment and wages. British research tends to indicate that migrants have two impacts. Medium and high-paid workers gain, partly because they benefit from the cheaper services of the low-paid migrant workers. But the lowest paid resident workers can lose out in competition at the bottom. Further data suggests that immigration from outside the EU could lead to more unemployment of UK workers during a recession - but these effects can change over time if migration leads to greater employment, productivity and business opportunities. A recent study found the biggest losers could be existing migrants who find themselves in competition with newly arrived workers who have similar skills at a lower price. Source: Oxford University's Migration Observatory Neil Carberry, of business lobby group the CBI, said the evidence clearly showed the \"vast majority\" of migrants came to the UK to study or work, not to claim benefits. The government was right to pursue a managed immigration policy, he told the BBC, but warned a one-size-fits-all approach that did not recognise different types of migration should be resisted and making assumptions based on migrants' home countries added little to the debate. Don Flynn, director of charity Migrants' Rights Network, said the analysis appeared to be spun to suggest that migrants were more likely to receive benefits than UK-born people, and some migrants were poor performers. But, he said, the overall position remained that migrants performed better than their cost to the taxpayer, and there was nothing in the study to challenge that.

The force said it has informed Operation Hydrant, which oversees allegations of historical child sex abuse against high-profile people. Lord Tonypandy, who was born in Port Talbot, died of cancer in 1997 aged 88. Then known as George Thomas, he was a Labour MP in Cardiff from 1945 to 1983. The methodist preacher was also Secretary of State for Wales from 1968 to 1970 and was Commons Speaker between 1976 and 1983. Allegations of historical child sexual abuse were made against him four years ago. A man, now in his fifties, living in Australia, alleged that Lord Tonypandy had sexually assaulted him in Cardiff when he was nine years old while he was staying at the boy's parents home in the 1960s and 1970s. Other allegations against him included that he sexually assaulted a 16 or 17-year-old boy on a train between Newport and London in the 1960s. There were also claims he inappropriately touched someone on a train from London to Aberystwyth in 1959. On Wednesday, South Wales Police said its investigation has come to an end and that no further action would be taken. \"These allegations have been investigated proportionately by South Wales Police in line with national guidance,\" it said in a statement. \"The force takes all allegations of sexual abuse seriously no matter when the alleged offence took place and encourages any victims of sexual abuse to come forward, in the knowledge that they will be listened to and their allegations taken seriously.\" Friends and people who knew Lord Tonypandy have previously said they found the allegations difficult to believe.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nA former Labour MP who died in 1997 is being investigated over allegations of historical child sexual abuse .  \n\n[INST] 2 / 2Write a title for this article: Former Labour MP Lord Tonypandy investigated over child sex abuse allegations [", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "A", "▁former", "▁Labour", "▁MP", "▁who", "▁died", "▁in", "▁", "1", "9", "9", "7", "▁is", "▁being", "▁investig", "ated", "▁over", "▁alleg", "ations", "▁of", "▁historical", "▁child", "▁sexual", "▁ab", "use", "▁.", "▁▁", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "[", "INST", "]", "▁", "2", "▁/", "▁", "2", "Write", "▁a", "▁title", "▁for", "▁this", "▁article", ":", "▁Form", "er", "▁Labour", "▁MP", "▁Lord", "▁Ton", "yp", "andy", "▁investig", "ated", "▁over", "▁child", "▁sex", "▁ab", "use", "▁alleg", "ations", "▁[", "/"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.2017395794391632, -0.8976171016693115, -0.2669633626937866, -0.03543757647275925, -1.0076179504394531, -0.07895243167877197, -0.01214184146374464, -1.6689286894688848e-06, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.18775388598442078, -0.13434669375419617, -0.005128205753862858, 0.0, -0.17513974010944366, -0.111488938331604, -1.9788545614574105e-05, -0.02023540809750557, -0.39793962240219116, -0.015414273366332054, -0.05274356156587601, -2.3841855067985307e-07, 0.0, -0.035491764545440674, -0.5064237713813782, -1.0728830375228426e-06, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -0.08084218949079514, 0.0, 0.0, -0.79587322473526, -0.21701596677303314, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -1.2226557731628418, -0.07894185185432434, -0.005537171848118305, 0.0, -3.576278118089249e-07, -0.00019524575327523053, 0.0, -0.5021518468856812, 0.0, -0.43984872102737427, -0.001085764612071216, -0.3023205101490021, -0.004461928736418486, 0.0, 0.0, -0.4013606011867523, 0.0, -0.0008386432309634984, -0.8382552862167358, -0.1786586493253708, -0.05293409153819084, 0.0, -0.5068828463554382, -4.768370445162873e-07, -0.003193875541910529, -1.1920928244535389e-07], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "A": -0.2017395794391632, "▁former": -0.8976171016693115, "▁Labour": -0.43984872102737427, "▁MP": -0.001085764612071216, "▁who": -1.0076179504394531, "▁died": -0.07895243167877197, "▁in": -0.01214184146374464, "▁": 0.0, "1": 0.0, "9": 0.0, "7": 0.0, "▁is": -0.18775388598442078, "▁being": -0.13434669375419617, "▁investig": -0.4013606011867523, "ated": 0.0, "▁over": -0.0008386432309634984, "▁alleg": -0.5068828463554382, "ations": -4.768370445162873e-07, "▁of": -0.02023540809750557, "▁historical": -0.39793962240219116, "▁child": -0.8382552862167358, "▁sexual": -0.05274356156587601, "▁ab": -0.05293409153819084, "use": 0.0, "▁.": -0.035491764545440674, "▁▁": -0.5064237713813782, "[": -0.08084218949079514, "INST": 0.0, "]": 0.0, "2": 0.0, "▁/": 0.0, "Write": -1.2226557731628418, "▁a": -0.07894185185432434, "▁title": -0.005537171848118305, "▁for": 0.0, "▁this": -3.576278118089249e-07, "▁article": -0.00019524575327523053, ":": 0.0, "▁Form": -0.5021518468856812, "er": 0.0, "▁Lord": -0.3023205101490021, "▁Ton": -0.004461928736418486, "yp": 0.0, "andy": 0.0, "▁sex": -0.1786586493253708, "▁[": -0.003193875541910529, "/": -1.1920928244535389e-07}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

Brazil's Joao Gomes Junior took silver and South African Cameron van der Burgh was third. \"I'm feeling very good. I'm so, so happy with my displays,\" Peaty said. He was speaking to the BBC after taking part in the 4x100m mixed medley relay final, in which defending champions Britain finished fifth. USA won in a world record time of three minutes 38.56 seconds. Australia took silver, with China and Canada in joint third. It was a different story in his individual race, earlier. Peaty was level with his rivals in the first few strokes before he pulled away after 30 metres. The City of Derby swimmer appeared set to break the world record for a third time in two days, but narrowly fell short. The Briton suggested \"equilibrium\" was key to his successes. \"I'm a massive believer that all areas of your life need to be equal for you to perform at your best,\" he added. \"Lifestyle, family and friendships. If one is out then you are not going to be at that level.\" Media playback is not supported on this device Van der Burgh, the 2009 and 2013 world champion in the 50m breaststroke, paid tribute to Peaty's powerful performances. \"I think I have to retire and give it a few years and come back when he's older,\" joked the 29-year-old. \"It's really impressive. It's not even breaststroke anymore, he's swimming like a new kind of stroke, like a metamorphosis between [butter]fly and breast. Former British swimmer Mark Foster told BBC Sport that Peaty's display was \"immense\". \"There not enough words to describe how good he is,\" he said. \"Under 26 seconds for the second time - only four hundredths of a second off his best time. It was, again, an immense swim.\" Karen Pickering, British 2001 world 4x200m freestyle gold medallist We all know how strong Peaty is. In his semi-final he was a little bit lower in the water as he set his world record. Because he's not quite as high as he is in the 100m, he has a quicker turnover. He can keep that up for 50m, but not for a 100m - that's why he went to 25.95 seconds. You couldn't do that in the 100m because of the build-up of lactic acid. But because it's Adam Peaty, he might be able to manage that in a year. Watch the full interview on BBC Radio 5 live's page Rebecca Adlington, double Olympic champion at Beijing 2008 He is the poster boy for swimming across the world, not just in Britain Adam gets the biggest cheer from the crowd for a non-Hungarian for the whole meet. Everyone wants to see him do well because he's such a likeable character. No-one is even close to him, so you ask yourself how much more can he improve.

Doncaster believes the exciting drama of last season augurs well for the new campaign. \"After such an exciting end to last season: we had Aberdeen pushing Celtic close at the top and we had an incredible battle at the bottom of the Premiership with the top of the Championship in the play-offs; absolutely endorsing the decision the clubs made a couple of years ago to create them,\" he said. \"With Hearts returning to the top tier, you've still got Rangers and Hibernian in the Championship and I'm sure there'll be as much tension in the Championship this year as there was last. \"Who knows where Hearts will be this year? \"The league never gets to choose the clubs that appear at any level of the game.

No-one was hurt and those involved in the incident are being investigated by police, the Ministry of Justice said. The Prison Officers' Association said the issues surrounded a lack of regime due to insufficient staffing levels. A Ministry of Justice spokesman said \"two separate incidents\" involving three prisoners had been \"successfully resolved\" on Saturday. He added the prison was now \"running as normal\" and said there had been \"some minor structural damage\". He said: \"We are absolutely clear that prisoners who behave in this way will be punished and can spend significantly longer behind bars.\" The Prison Officers' Association (POA) said order was restored overnight on Saturday but said \"both wings were destroyed and were now out of commission\". The POA spokesman added this was \"another example of a failed benchmark process brought about by savage and unnecessary government cuts that has seen staffing levels decrease to an unsafe level\". Relatives of inmates also got in touch with the BBC saying prisoners were kept locked in their cells for three days, without hot food, hot water and no prison officers on some wings. Conservative MP, for Devizes, Claire Perry said: \"I was saddened to hear of the disturbances at Erlestoke Prison over the last few days. \"These incidents are wholly and utterly unacceptable, and I understand that these matters have been referred to the police to consider charges against the perpetrators.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nA prison in Wiltshire has been the scene of a riot and a number of inmates have been injured.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "A", "▁prison", "▁in", "▁W", "ilt", "shire", "▁has", "▁been", "▁the", "▁scene", "▁of", "▁a", "▁ri", "ot", "▁and", "▁a", "▁number", "▁of", "▁in", "m", "ates", "▁have", "▁been", "▁injured", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁The", "▁", "1", "9", "6", "0", "s", "▁and", "▁", "1", "9", "7", "0", "s", "▁were", "▁a", "▁golden", "▁age", "▁for", "▁the", "▁British", "▁music", "▁industry", ",", "▁with", "▁the", "▁UK", "▁producing", "▁some", "▁of"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.08939633518457413, -0.003088349476456642, -0.0005772831500507891, -0.5561310052871704, 0.0, 0.0, -0.4704345762729645, -0.00023314618738368154, -0.7072561979293823, -0.000839238753542304, 0.0, -0.13529956340789795, -0.031136300414800644, 0.0, -0.6355059146881104, -0.13643760979175568, -0.2431960552930832, 0.0, -0.0789349153637886, 0.0, 0.0, -0.17364726960659027, -0.11735972762107849, -0.39275693893432617, -0.006845356430858374, -8.583032467868179e-06, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.17458225786685944, -0.1690114140510559, -0.40179643034935, -0.3438257873058319, -0.41164082288742065, -0.5844232439994812, -1.07287787614041e-05, -0.9648802280426025, -0.015517215244472027, -0.00292397802695632, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.17406024038791656, -0.05441129952669144, -0.6954091191291809, -0.0019427727675065398, -0.002924453467130661, -0.03208443894982338, -0.06835298985242844, -0.8000420928001404, -0.010555745102465153, -0.2571276128292084, -0.20399412512779236, -0.19752933084964752, -0.7405225038528442, -0.07299215346574783, -0.26295697689056396, 0.0], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "A": -0.08939633518457413, "▁prison": -0.003088349476456642, "▁in": -0.0789349153637886, "▁W": -0.5561310052871704, "ilt": 0.0, "shire": 0.0, "▁has": -0.4704345762729645, "▁been": -0.11735972762107849, "▁the": -0.19752933084964752, "▁scene": -0.000839238753542304, "▁of": 0.0, "▁a": -0.05441129952669144, "▁ri": -0.031136300414800644, "ot": 0.0, "▁and": -0.9648802280426025, "▁number": -0.2431960552930832, "m": 0.0, "ates": 0.0, "▁have": -0.17364726960659027, "▁injured": -0.39275693893432617, ".": -0.006845356430858374, "##": 0.0, "#": 0.0, "Art": 0.0, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "▁The": -0.17458225786685944, "▁": -0.015517215244472027, "1": -0.00292397802695632, "9": 0.0, "6": -0.41164082288742065, "0": 0.0, "s": 0.0, "7": 0.0, "▁were": -0.17406024038791656, "▁golden": -0.6954091191291809, "▁age": -0.0019427727675065398, "▁for": -0.002924453467130661, "▁British": -0.06835298985242844, "▁music": -0.8000420928001404, "▁industry": -0.010555745102465153, ",": -0.2571276128292084, "▁with": -0.20399412512779236, "▁UK": -0.7405225038528442, "▁producing": -0.07299215346574783, "▁some": -0.26295697689056396}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

Currently some 1,200 members of the security forces are chasing the elusive gang leader. That is more than double the 500 who hunted Pablo Escobar, the drug lord who controlled the infamous cocaine cartel of the same name. Otoniel runs the Usuga clan, a drug gang that has its powerbase in the Uraba region of Colombia, but whose network extends across the country and beyond. Members of the gang have been arrested as far away as Argentina, Brazil, Honduras, Peru and Spain. The US Department of State describes it as a \"heavily armed, extremely violent criminal organisation\". It is offering up to $5m (Â£3.4m) for information leading to Otoniel's arrest. Otoniel has been in charge since his brother, Juan de Dios, was killed on 1 January 2012 when police raided his New Year's Eve party. The gang is first and foremost engaged in drug trafficking, but it has also been accused of extortion, illegal mining, forced disappearances and murder. It is very much a family business. Otoniel's partner, Blanca Senobia Madrid Benjumea, was in charge of the group's finances until her capture last month. His nephew, Harlison Usuga, looked after the drug traffic routes north to Central America and liaised with Mexican drug cartels until he, too, was captured in February. Over the past five years, the security forces have captured a whopping 6,700 members of the group. But its leader has evaded them so far. Last month, they launched a massive and costly operation to catch the elusive gang leader. Sources linked to the operation say $225,000 was spent on tracking down Otoniel in the first 25 days of the hunt. The people tasked with arresting him have been given clear orders from President Juan Manuel Santos and Defence Minister Juan Carlos Pinzon: Do not leave Uraba until you have caught Otoniel and have dismantled the whole clan. So far, the security forces have seized 5.5 tonnes of cocaine, and destroyed a number of coca crops and laboratories that turn leaves into cocaine. But they have yet to find Otoniel. His uncanny ability to dodge the security forces is partly due to his family's close ties to the region. Otoniel was born in Uraba and knows the region like the back of his hand. Most importantly, through threats and intimidation he has gained almost total control over the local community. When he called on locals to down tools to mark his brother's death at the hand of the police, the region came to a standstill for several days. When people in the region hear Otoniel's name mentioned, they react with fear. It is hard for the security forces to gain people's trust here, and it is something they have not yet fully managed. Moreover, Otoniel uses a variety of tricks to evade the police. He has trained dogs to alert him to anyone approaching his hide-outs. Police recently managed to catch one of his guard dogs\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nA Colombian drug lord is on the run, and the government is offering a $5 million reward for information leading to his arrest.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "A", "▁Colomb", "ian", "▁drug", "▁lord", "▁is", "▁on", "▁the", "▁run", ",", "▁and", "▁the", "▁government", "▁is", "▁offering", "▁a", "▁$", "5", "▁million", "▁reward", "▁for", "▁information", "▁leading", "▁to", "▁his", "▁arrest", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁The", "▁", "1", "0", "0", "▁most", "▁influ", "ential", "▁people", "▁in", "▁the", "▁world", ",", "▁according", "▁to", "▁T", "IME", "▁magazine", ",", "▁are", ":", "▁▁", "1", ".", "▁Bar", "ack", "▁Ob", "ama"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.27973803877830505, -0.18628737330436707, 0.0, -0.0001679517881711945, -0.004973540082573891, -0.11791420727968216, -0.43506965041160583, 0.0, -2.145764938177308e-06, -0.7529149055480957, -0.0015870844945311546, -0.7195484042167664, -0.45236319303512573, -0.012085780501365662, -0.003008722560480237, -0.026116620749235153, -0.03038063272833824, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -0.02324579656124115, -0.00010442188795423135, -4.589452510117553e-05, -0.17312826216220856, -0.00017510310863144696, 0.0, 0.0, -0.17300714552402496, -0.00010930894495686516, -0.006872113328427076, 0.0, -1.9788545614574105e-05, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.044844236224889755, -0.7431580424308777, -0.263601690530777, -0.11264950037002563, -0.1869513839483261, -0.45328289270401, -0.6585783362388611, 0.0, -6.496695277746767e-05, -0.0006890306831337512, -2.6702524337451905e-05, -3.814689989667386e-06, -0.09115167707204819, -0.3760797083377838, 0.0, -0.17309989035129547, 0.0, -0.12409188598394394, -0.06107914075255394, -0.11757341772317886, -0.6254162192344666, -0.04374336823821068, -0.011929595842957497, -0.00021514961554203182, -0.7677246332168579, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "A": -0.27973803877830505, "▁Colomb": -0.18628737330436707, "ian": 0.0, "▁drug": -0.0001679517881711945, "▁lord": -0.004973540082573891, "▁is": -0.012085780501365662, "▁on": -0.43506965041160583, "▁the": -2.6702524337451905e-05, "▁run": -2.145764938177308e-06, ",": -0.06107914075255394, "▁and": -0.0015870844945311546, "▁government": -0.45236319303512573, "▁offering": -0.003008722560480237, "▁a": -0.026116620749235153, "▁$": -0.03038063272833824, "5": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "▁million": -0.02324579656124115, "▁reward": -0.00010442188795423135, "▁for": -4.589452510117553e-05, "▁information": -0.17312826216220856, "▁leading": -0.00017510310863144696, "▁to": 0.0, "▁his": 0.0, "▁arrest": -0.17300714552402496, ".": -0.00021514961554203182, "##": -1.9788545614574105e-05, "#": 0.0, "Art": 0.0, "icle": 0.0, ":": -0.6254162192344666, "▁The": -0.044844236224889755, "▁": -0.7431580424308777, "1": -0.011929595842957497, "0": -0.1869513839483261, "▁most": -0.45328289270401, "▁influ": -0.6585783362388611, "ential": 0.0, "▁people": -6.496695277746767e-05, "▁in": -0.0006890306831337512, "▁world": -3.814689989667386e-06, "▁according": -0.3760797083377838, "▁T": -0.17309989035129547, "IME": 0.0, "▁magazine": -0.12409188598394394, "▁are": -0.11757341772317886, "▁▁": -0.04374336823821068, "▁Bar": -0.7677246332168579, "ack": 0.0, "▁Ob": 0.0, "ama": 0.0}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

The Australian Broadcasting Corp. quoted Sophia's grandmother, Vera Cook, who credited the dog with saving the toddler's life.

The test only runs for a few seconds, but it tells engineers that all nine engines at the base of the vehicle, and the sub-systems that support them, are functioning normally. If the test throws up no anomalies, the Falcon is given the green light to go ahead with its mission. Clearly, though, on this occasion, something went catastrophically wrong. The entire rocket and its satellite payload were destroyed in an explosion. Company CEO Elon Musk said the problem - whatever it was - occurred during the operation to fill the rocket with propellant, so the event happened just prior to the test ignition. Remarkably, the lightning towers surrounding the pad stayed standing in the face of the blast, and so did the erector tower that is used to feed cables and fluids to the rocket. Undoubtedly, though, Launch Complex 40 as it is known, will have suffered significant damage. Twisted and bent metal was visible to long-range cameras. But the repairs to the pad are only a part of SpaceX's immediate problems. Its launch schedule will now be put on hold, perhaps for many weeks, as engineers try to understand what happened and to correct any procedural errors and hardware failures. That is going to be a headache for SpaceX's many customers who are waiting patiently for a ride. The Amos-6 satellite that was lost in the explosion is just one spacecraft in a very long line of platforms that have contracts to fly on the Falcon. They have little option but to accept the delay; you cannot very easily swap rockets like you can swap trains. Most of the backlog is made up of commercial payloads, and every extra month these expensive satellites stay on the ground will hit their operators' revenues. Consider customers like Iridium - one of the main sat-phone providers. It was due to send up the first 10 spacecraft in its new constellation of satellites on a Falcon later this month. Iridium has big loans that need to be serviced. At Nasa, too, they will be frustrated. The agency sends cargo to the space station on Falcons, and the next freight mission was scheduled for November. More concerning however is the shadow this incident casts over the issue of human transportation. SpaceX has a contract to use its Falcon to take astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS). Manned test flights were expected in the next 18 months. Is that timeline realistic now? This is the second accident involving a Falcon inside 15 months, after a vehicle broke up in flight in June 2015. The Falcon's performance will have reverberations with the US military also. SpaceX is working hard to convince the Pentagon that it has a reliable rocket system that can be entrusted with high-value national security missions. That job just got a little harder. Setbacks are inevitable in this business, however, and SpaceX has shown before that it can bounce back.

A complaint is being reviewed by the Church of England, his lawyer said. Clergy representatives said they were unable to comment on the claims published in the Guardian as they formed part of an active investigation. The priest said all five men were aware of his claims he had been repeatedly raped by a vicar when he was 16 in 1984, but none of them acted. He said he made the allegations verbally to the Right Reverend Peter Burrows, the Bishop of Doncaster; the Right Reverend Steven Croft, the former Bishop of Sheffield, and now Bishop of Oxford; and the Right Reverend Martyn Snow, a former Archdeacon of Sheffield and Rotherham, and now the Bishop of Leicester, between July 2012 and February 2013. The Archbishop of York John Sentamu and the Right Reverend Glyn Webster, the Bishop of Beverley, were also made aware when they were copied in to a letter sent to the Rt Rev Croft in June 2013, he said. His lawyer, David Greenwood, of Switalskis Solicitors, said the priest finally spoke up after a safeguarding issue in his own parish \"triggered his memories\". \"He reached out for help to the Bishop of Doncaster but found that he got no help, no support and no response,\" he said. \"He continued to try to elicit a response from the senior people in his diocese but got nothing.\" Under the Church of England's clergy disciplinary measures a complaint must be made within one year of the alleged misconduct. An application for permission to make complaints out of time has been lodged and is being considered by the church. Mr Greenwood said a complaint had also been made to West Yorkshire Police and the details of the alleged misconduct passed to the Goddard Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse. A spokesperson for the archbishop said he had only been sent a copy of the letter and the original recipient of the letter had \"a duty to respond and not the archbishop\". A spokesperson for the bishops said that if the complaint went forward \"our bishops will make a full response to the various allegations made in due course\". A complaint has also been made by the priest against Roy Williamson, a former bishop of Bradford and now an honorary assistant bishop with the diocese of Southwell and Nottingham, that he failed to act at the time of the abuse. A spokesperson for his diocese said: \"We cannot comment during a live investigation except to say that if approached by the authorities we will offer them every co-operation.\" West Yorkshire Police said it is investigating a report of a historical serious sexual offence said to have occurred in the Bradford area in the 1980s. A force representative said: \"A crime has been recorded and a 69-year-old man has been spoken to in connection with the inquiry.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nA priest has accused five senior bishops in the Church of England of failing to act when he reported being raped by a vicar in the 1980s.

By 1996 the pharmacy chain had grown to 11 pharmacies and in 2006 the business expanded into Scotland where there are now nine stores. Today, the chain has 62 stores and employs approximately 800 people. Neil Gordon was born on 17 October 1952 in Newry, County Down. The son of a farmer, and one of five brothers, his interest in pharmacy was sparked at a young age. He was educated at Newry Model Primary school and Newry Grammar school before studying pharmacy at Bradford University. After a period of employment that included working in England, Neil established the first Gordons Chemists in Donaghadee in 1980. He was also a co-founder of the Donaghadee Comunity Workforce, assisting the long-term unemployed back into employment, while engaging in work of community benefit. He served as an elder at Shore Street Presbyterian Church, Donaghadee and was a trustee of the Lighthouse Trust, a charity serving children with cerebral palsy. Neil was elected to the executive committee of Belfast city centre management in 2004 and served until his death. He was elected to the board of the PCC (Pharmaceutical Contractors Committee), the committee responsible for negotiating community pharmacy services with the Department of Health, and served for seven years. He also served on the board of SOS Bus NI, a charity helping vulnerable people on the streets of Belfast. In 2013, Neil was awarded a Fellowship of the Pharmaceutical Society of Northern Ireland. Neil passed away on 20 June. He is survived by his mum, Jean, wife, Carol, sons, Ryan and Gareth, and daughter Fiona.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nNeil Gordon, a pharmacy entrepreneur who founded the Gordons Chemists chain in Northern Ireland, has died.  \n\n[INST] Write a title for this article: \"Brazil's Lula to visit Cuba, Venezuela\"\n\n\"Brazilian President Lui", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "Ne", "il", "▁Gordon", ",", "▁a", "▁ph", "arm", "acy", "▁entrepr", "ene", "ur", "▁who", "▁founded", "▁the", "▁G", "ord", "ons", "▁Chem", "ists", "▁chain", "▁in", "▁Northern", "▁Ireland", ",", "▁has", "▁died", ".", "▁▁", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "[", "INST", "]", "▁Write", "▁a", "▁title", "▁for", "▁this", "▁article", ":", "▁\"", "B", "raz", "il", "'", "s", "▁L", "ula", "▁to", "▁visit", "▁Cuba", ",", "▁Venezuela", "\"", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "\"", "B", "raz", "ilian", "▁President", "▁Lu", "iz"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.07946564257144928, 0.0, 0.0, -0.003200054634362459, -0.2515522241592407, -0.038699112832546234, -3.6954811548639555e-06, -0.11735103279352188, -0.5432265996932983, 0.0, 0.0, -0.17175538837909698, -0.06939686089754105, -0.4849904179573059, -0.020585928112268448, 0.0, 0.0, -0.18014445900917053, -0.023245446383953094, -5.1616290875244886e-05, -0.36438003182411194, -0.0007124984404072165, 0.0, -0.006764607038348913, -0.12129401415586472, -0.00036459474358707666, -0.5520344972610474, -1.0131908655166626, 0.0, 0.0, -0.44519758224487305, 0.0, 0.0, -0.4065963923931122, -0.023666631430387497, -0.012839153409004211, -2.7418097943154862e-06, -0.11735686659812927, -0.00019834458362311125, 0.0, -0.10953757166862488, -0.734394907951355, -1.0912024974822998, -0.010181749239563942, -0.0073417858220636845, 0.0, -0.7171756029129028, -8.344646857949556e-07, -0.5362313985824585, -0.2685106098651886, -0.6186195015907288, -0.19999326765537262, -0.07405831664800644, -0.3839375078678131, -0.3608842194080353, 0.0, -0.4732310175895691, -0.0016969341086223722, -3.576278118089249e-07, -0.6931471824645996, -2.50339189733495e-06, -1.0728830375228426e-06, 0.0], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "Ne": -0.07946564257144928, "il": -0.010181749239563942, "▁Gordon": 0.0, ",": -0.19999326765537262, "▁a": -0.023666631430387497, "▁ph": -0.038699112832546234, "arm": -3.6954811548639555e-06, "acy": -0.11735103279352188, "▁entrepr": -0.5432265996932983, "ene": 0.0, "ur": 0.0, "▁who": -0.17175538837909698, "▁founded": -0.06939686089754105, "▁the": -0.4849904179573059, "▁G": -0.020585928112268448, "ord": 0.0, "ons": 0.0, "▁Chem": -0.18014445900917053, "ists": -0.023245446383953094, "▁chain": -5.1616290875244886e-05, "▁in": -0.36438003182411194, "▁Northern": -0.0007124984404072165, "▁Ireland": 0.0, "▁has": -0.12129401415586472, "▁died": -0.00036459474358707666, ".": -0.5520344972610474, "▁▁": -1.0131908655166626, "[": -0.44519758224487305, "INST": 0.0, "]": 0.0, "▁Write": -0.4065963923931122, "▁title": -0.012839153409004211, "▁for": -2.7418097943154862e-06, "▁this": -0.11735686659812927, "▁article": -0.00019834458362311125, ":": 0.0, "▁\"": -0.10953757166862488, "B": -0.0016969341086223722, "raz": -3.576278118089249e-07, "'": -0.0073417858220636845, "s": 0.0, "▁L": -0.7171756029129028, "ula": -8.344646857949556e-07, "▁to": -0.5362313985824585, "▁visit": -0.2685106098651886, "▁Cuba": -0.6186195015907288, "▁Venezuela": -0.07405831664800644, "\"": -0.4732310175895691, "ilian": -0.6931471824645996, "▁President": -2.50339189733495e-06, "▁Lu": -1.0728830375228426e-06, "iz": 0.0}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

The collapse happened between junctions four and three, near the junction with the M26 which links the M25 London orbital with the M20. The road, which is the main route to the Channel Tunnel and Port of Dover, had to be closed while two large cranes worked to clear the debris. The road was closed again the following weekend for the remains of the partially collapsed pedestrian bridge to be removed.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\n\nA man has been charged after a bridge collapsed on a motorway near London.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "A", "▁man", "▁has", "▁been", "▁charged", "▁after", "▁a", "▁bridge", "▁col", "lapsed", "▁on", "▁a", "▁motor", "way", "▁near", "▁London", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁The", "▁", "2", "2", "-", "year", "-", "old", "▁man", "▁was", "▁arrested", "▁on", "▁Wed", "nes", "day", "▁at", "▁the", "▁scene", "▁of", "▁the", "▁attack", "▁in", "▁the", "▁city", "'", "s", "▁northern", "▁sub", "ur", "bs", ".", "▁He", "▁was", "▁charged", "▁with", "▁murder", ","], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.5064332485198975, -0.08014078438282013, -0.6145710945129395, -0.2309955209493637, 0.0, -0.05490972474217415, -0.1422567069530487, -0.0006719953380525112, -0.2553957998752594, -0.25305941700935364, -1.9788545614574105e-05, -0.010839628055691719, -0.052855510264635086, -0.0003846143954433501, 0.0, -0.019121481105685234, -0.08612839877605438, -0.1787443906068802, -0.00024256148026324809, 0.0, -1.9788545614574105e-05, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.023577215149998665, -0.0497189536690712, -0.4399096965789795, -0.4294668138027191, -1.3947389561508317e-05, -2.622600959512056e-06, 0.0, 0.0, -0.5688124895095825, -0.05645072087645531, -0.10773546248674393, -0.3528147339820862, -0.02274787798523903, 0.0, 0.0, -1.4118893146514893, -0.4025370180606842, -0.510270357131958, -0.00043990471749566495, -0.07922767847776413, -0.06934169679880142, -0.6872354745864868, -0.0023902675602585077, -0.6180140972137451, -0.13819968700408936, 0.0, -0.45709797739982605, -0.001378896413370967, -0.11735103279352188, 0.0, -0.07943734526634216, -0.7408297657966614, -0.14504848420619965, -0.015891801565885544, -0.0002474478678777814, -0.7543137669563293, -0.5066937804222107], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "A": -0.08014078438282013, "▁man": -0.5688124895095825, "▁has": -0.2309955209493637, "▁been": 0.0, "▁charged": -0.015891801565885544, "▁after": -0.1422567069530487, "▁a": -0.052855510264635086, "▁bridge": -0.2553957998752594, "▁col": -0.25305941700935364, "lapsed": -1.9788545614574105e-05, "▁on": -0.3528147339820862, "▁motor": -0.0003846143954433501, "way": 0.0, "▁near": -0.019121481105685234, "▁London": -0.08612839877605438, ".": -0.07943734526634216, "##": -1.9788545614574105e-05, "#": 0.0, "Art": 0.0, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "▁The": -0.023577215149998665, "▁": -0.0497189536690712, "2": -0.4294668138027191, "-": 0.0, "year": -2.622600959512056e-06, "old": 0.0, "▁was": -0.14504848420619965, "▁arrested": -0.10773546248674393, "▁Wed": -0.02274787798523903, "nes": 0.0, "day": 0.0, "▁at": -1.4118893146514893, "▁the": -0.0023902675602585077, "▁scene": -0.510270357131958, "▁of": -0.00043990471749566495, "▁attack": -0.06934169679880142, "▁in": -0.6872354745864868, "▁city": -0.6180140972137451, "'": -0.13819968700408936, "s": 0.0, "▁northern": -0.45709797739982605, "▁sub": -0.001378896413370967, "ur": -0.11735103279352188, "bs": 0.0, "▁He": -0.7408297657966614, "▁with": -0.0002474478678777814, "▁murder": -0.7543137669563293, ",": -0.5066937804222107}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

Prime Minister Sorin Grindeanu says the move would ease overcrowding in prisons. His critics say he is trying to release allies convicted of corruption. They also want the proposals to be debated in parliament. Mr Grindeanu's plan is for the measures to be implemented through emergency decrees that bypass parliament and do not require the signature of President Klaus Iohannis. Those who would be due for release include several elected officials and magistrates convicted of corruption. President Iohannis joined protesters in Bucharest on Sunday, saying they were rightly indignant. \"Several political officials who have judicial issues want to change the legislation and weaken the rule of law,\" he said. \"It is unacceptable to modify the law so that the cases of dozens, even hundreds, of politicians, are wiped out.\" President Iohannis was elected in November 2014 and has vowed to stamp out entrenched corruption. However, the chairman of the ruling Social Democrats, Liviu Dragnea, accused the president of \"inciting social disorder and violence\" and said the protest was the start of a coup. A former minister, Mr Dragnea was himself given a suspended prison sentence in 2015 for using bribes and forged ballot papers to influence an impeachment vote in 2012 against then President Traian Basescu.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nRomanian President Iohannis has joined protesters in Bucharest, saying they were rightly indignant at the government's plans to change the law to reduce prison sentences for corruption convicts.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "R", "oman", "ian", "▁President", "▁I", "oh", "ann", "is", "▁has", "▁joined", "▁protest", "ers", "▁in", "▁Buch", "ar", "est", ",", "▁saying", "▁they", "▁were", "▁right", "ly", "▁ind", "ign", "ant", "▁at", "▁the", "▁government", "'", "s", "▁plans", "▁to", "▁change", "▁the", "▁law", "▁to", "▁reduce", "▁prison", "▁sentences", "▁for", "▁cor", "ruption", "▁conv", "ict", "s", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁The", "▁", "2", "0", "1", "8", "▁Winter", "▁Olympics", ","], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.9666380882263184, -7.152555099310121e-07, -0.36089006066322327, -0.2204311490058899, -0.5063611268997192, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.5288457870483398, -0.12018700689077377, -0.013209803961217403, -0.010172544978559017, -0.19308272004127502, -0.010197915136814117, 0.0, 0.0, -0.39572861790657043, -0.018197722733020782, -0.0007474012672901154, -0.6931635141372681, -2.3841855067985307e-07, -5.602820692729438e-06, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.5592197179794312, -0.5890489220619202, -6.05564855504781e-05, -2.9682672902708873e-05, 0.0, -0.34427207708358765, -1.3708974620385561e-05, -0.37217727303504944, -0.041589103639125824, -0.02152405120432377, -0.06179818511009216, -1.3969613313674927, -0.0803646668791771, -0.6946370005607605, -0.26453688740730286, -0.04600275680422783, -0.023245446383953094, -0.029330629855394363, 0.0, -0.5063611268997192, -0.05305686965584755, -0.004855864215642214, 0.0, -0.004442940000444651, 0.0, 0.0, -2.3841855067985307e-07, 0.0, 0.0, -0.07506053894758224, -0.8903125524520874, -0.1966228038072586, -0.00796156283468008, -0.0030310661531984806, -0.21605558693408966, -0.2444138377904892, -0.00010573305189609528, -0.6924080848693848], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "R": -0.9666380882263184, "oman": -7.152555099310121e-07, "ian": -0.36089006066322327, "▁President": -0.2204311490058899, "▁I": -0.5063611268997192, "oh": 0.0, "ann": 0.0, "is": 0.0, "▁has": -0.5288457870483398, "▁joined": -0.12018700689077377, "▁protest": -0.013209803961217403, "ers": -0.010172544978559017, "▁in": -0.19308272004127502, "▁Buch": -0.010197915136814117, "ar": 0.0, "est": 0.0, ",": -0.6924080848693848, "▁saying": -0.018197722733020782, "▁they": -0.0007474012672901154, "▁were": -0.6931635141372681, "▁right": -2.3841855067985307e-07, "ly": -5.602820692729438e-06, "▁ind": 0.0, "ign": 0.0, "ant": 0.0, "▁at": -0.5592197179794312, "▁the": -0.041589103639125824, "▁government": -6.05564855504781e-05, "'": -2.9682672902708873e-05, "s": -0.5063611268997192, "▁plans": -0.34427207708358765, "▁to": -0.06179818511009216, "▁change": -0.37217727303504944, "▁law": -0.02152405120432377, "▁reduce": -1.3969613313674927, "▁prison": -0.0803646668791771, "▁sentences": -0.6946370005607605, "▁for": -0.26453688740730286, "▁cor": -0.04600275680422783, "ruption": -0.023245446383953094, "▁conv": -0.029330629855394363, "ict": 0.0, ".": -0.05305686965584755, "##": -0.004442940000444651, "#": 0.0, "Art": -2.3841855067985307e-07, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "▁The": -0.07506053894758224, "▁": -0.8903125524520874, "2": -0.1966228038072586, "0": -0.00796156283468008, "1": -0.0030310661531984806, "8": -0.21605558693408966, "▁Winter": -0.2444138377904892, "▁Olympics": -0.00010573305189609528}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

The Antonov An-12 plane was heading to Paloch, Upper Nile State, and crashed 800m (half a mile) from the runway. In a statement, Ukraine-based Antonov said the plane had not been airworthy. It said the plane, which was built in 1971, \"was is no state to fly because it failed to undergo timely technical servicing... that should have included work on extending its resources and exploitation timeframe\", AFP news agency reported. South Sudan authorities warned that the death toll could rise as the debris was cleared. The plane crashed into a farming community on an island on the White Nile River but so far all the victims recovered were from the aircraft, the Red Cross said. Presidential spokesman Ateny Wek Ateny said all of the plane's passengers were from South Sudan. He said five of the six crew members were Armenian, while the sixth member was Russian. Armenia's foreign ministry has confirmed that five of its nationals were killed. The head of the Civil Aviation at Juba airport said emergency officials had secured the site of the crash and were \"in the stage of recovering bodies and black box [flight recorder]\". While the cause of the crash is still unclear, the presidential spokesman told a news conference that it might have been down to engine failure. Witnesses said bodies, debris and cargo were strewn over a wide area along the river bank. A man who saw the plane come down said he thought it might crash into a market area, but the pilot seemed to divert at the last minute. A local farmer described the moment the plane started to go down, telling AFP: \"The sound was so loud... the plane started descending and landed near my door. \"One of the tyres broke off and ran into the house - but thank God it did not injure anyone.\" Cargo planes flying to remote parts of South Sudan often carry passengers too. The plane's first flight was in 1971, the Aviation Safety Network reported. It was being operated by Allied Services Limited, a logistics company based in South Sudan, at the time of the crash. However, the plane belonged to the Tajik company Asia Airways, Tajikistan's Transport Ministry told the Ozodagon news agency.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nA cargo plane crashed in South Sudan, killing five people and leaving a young boy as the only survivor.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "A", "▁cargo", "▁plane", "▁crash", "ed", "▁in", "▁South", "▁Sud", "an", ",", "▁killing", "▁five", "▁people", "▁and", "▁leaving", "▁a", "▁young", "▁boy", "▁as", "▁the", "▁only", "▁surv", "iv", "or", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁The", "▁US", "▁military", "▁has", "▁said", "▁it", "▁will", "▁send", "▁", "5", ",", "2", "0", "0", "▁additional", "▁troops", "▁to", "▁the", "▁Middle", "▁East", ",", "▁cit", "ing", "▁\"", "ind", "ic", "ations", "\"", "▁that", "▁Iran"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.01549033634364605, -0.1739846169948578, 0.0, -0.15415923297405243, -3.576278118089249e-07, -0.02348196879029274, -9.059865078597795e-06, 0.0, 0.0, -0.36213985085487366, -2.098061486321967e-05, -0.13355021178722382, -0.22004933655261993, -0.04372568055987358, -0.03505516052246094, -0.002495034597814083, -0.0006642519147135317, -9.298280929215252e-06, -0.0029240967705845833, 0.0, -0.015404412522912025, -2.50339189733495e-06, 0.0, 0.0, -0.17306549847126007, -0.0009436921682208776, 0.0, -0.00010513706365600228, 0.0, 0.0, -1.1920928244535389e-07, 0.0, 0.0, -0.1834767609834671, -0.6651189923286438, -0.8083358407020569, -0.2526954412460327, -0.7983138561248779, -0.2527492344379425, -0.8148787617683411, -0.7870606780052185, -0.42244040966033936, -0.21090996265411377, -0.1730092614889145, -0.00084436044562608, 0.0, 0.0, -0.3471207320690155, -0.00042060110718011856, -5.722029527532868e-06, -0.12778793275356293, -0.0033356286585330963, 0.0, -0.9981657862663269, -0.039751820266246796, 0.0, -0.04165039584040642, -0.30869999527931213, 0.0, -0.00010442188795423135, -0.0008387623238377273, -0.38549360632896423, -6.913899414939806e-05], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "A": -0.01549033634364605, "▁cargo": -0.1739846169948578, "▁plane": 0.0, "▁crash": -0.15415923297405243, "ed": -3.576278118089249e-07, "▁in": -0.02348196879029274, "▁South": -9.059865078597795e-06, "▁Sud": 0.0, "an": 0.0, ",": -0.9981657862663269, "▁killing": -2.098061486321967e-05, "▁five": -0.13355021178722382, "▁people": -0.22004933655261993, "▁and": -0.04372568055987358, "▁leaving": -0.03505516052246094, "▁a": -0.002495034597814083, "▁young": -0.0006642519147135317, "▁boy": -9.298280929215252e-06, "▁as": -0.0029240967705845833, "▁the": -0.12778793275356293, "▁only": -0.015404412522912025, "▁surv": -2.50339189733495e-06, "iv": 0.0, "or": 0.0, ".": -0.17306549847126007, "##": -0.00010513706365600228, "#": 0.0, "Art": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "▁The": -0.1834767609834671, "▁US": -0.6651189923286438, "▁military": -0.8083358407020569, "▁has": -0.2526954412460327, "▁said": -0.7983138561248779, "▁it": -0.2527492344379425, "▁will": -0.8148787617683411, "▁send": -0.7870606780052185, "▁": -0.42244040966033936, "5": -0.21090996265411377, "2": -0.00084436044562608, "0": 0.0, "▁additional": -0.3471207320690155, "▁troops": -0.00042060110718011856, "▁to": -5.722029527532868e-06, "▁Middle": -0.0033356286585330963, "▁East": 0.0, "▁cit": -0.039751820266246796, "ing": 0.0, "▁\"": -0.04165039584040642, "ind": -0.30869999527931213, "ic": 0.0, "ations": -0.00010442188795423135, "\"": -0.0008387623238377273, "▁that": -0.38549360632896423, "▁Iran": -6.913899414939806e-05}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

Unions will not make a recommendation to their members on whether to accept or reject the proposal. Tata is consulting staff on moving to the new scheme, calling it essential. It has launched a series of \"roadshows\" for staff to explain what moving from the current final salary pensions will mean for them. The new defined contribution scheme will see 10% paid in by the business and 6% by the employees. Although this is not as generous as current provisions, experts say it is better than many other company schemes. The unions believe the company is responsible for explaining to workers why it thinks the changes are necessary. They say they will not ballot members until Tata has explained all the details. Tata has made it clear the changes are required in order for it to commit to a new package at Port Talbot, including investing Â£1bn over 10 years. There is also a guarantee to keep operating two blast furnaces at the site for five years and to try to avoid compulsory redundancies over the same period. Any extra investment from Tata is also linked to improved productivity and savings at Port Talbot. It is understood many workers are angry the pension proposals are back on the table after Tata was forced to back down from similar plans 18 months ago when unions threatened strike action. There has also been criticism over a lack of detailed information from the company. Steel worker David Edwards, who has worked at the Port Talbot plant for 11 years, said the general mood among workers was \"pretty depressing\". \"The more we seem to be hearing, the more fine print then, it doesn't seem to be as good a deal as it originally sounded like,\" he said. \"The pensions have already been attacked, people have been pushed from working from 60 until 65... now they're coming for the pension again. \"It just seems to be one thing after the other.\" He added: \"People are worried for their future.\" Aberavon councillor Tony Taylor said some workers felt \"railroaded\" by the deal. But he added: \"I think this is the only game in town to be honest and it's given a lifeline of five, seven, 10 years. \"At least it's giving secure long-term jobs and it's going to be a stable industry for that time.\" The steelworkers union, Community, has said there is no better deal on the table from the company. Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies called on the first minister to work with Tata and unions and use his influence to help sell the deal to the workforce. Mr Davies said: \"Given that the first minister last week gave his unequivocal backing for the Tata deal in the Assembly chamber, it is now incumbent on him to work with the company and the unions to help sell the deal to the workforce.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nSteelworkers at Port Talbot are being asked to accept a less generous pension in return for future investment on site.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "Ste", "el", "work", "ers", "▁at", "▁Port", "▁Tal", "bot", "▁are", "▁being", "▁asked", "▁to", "▁accept", "▁a", "▁less", "▁gener", "ous", "▁p", "ension", "▁in", "▁return", "▁for", "▁future", "▁invest", "ment", "▁on", "▁site", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁The", "▁UK", "▁government", "▁is", "▁to", "▁ask", "▁the", "▁European", "▁Union", "▁to", "▁extend", "▁the", "▁Bre", "x", "it", "▁dead", "line", "▁to", "▁June", "▁", "3", "0", ",", "▁a", "▁senior", "▁government", "▁source"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.5725385546684265, 0.0, -0.023250805214047432, 0.0, -0.007913783192634583, -0.0014497257070615888, 0.0, 0.0, -0.545606255531311, -0.6176339983940125, -0.011570490896701813, -2.3841855067985307e-07, -0.0001486429391661659, -0.0044469754211604595, -0.0013305629836395383, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.12053018808364868, -0.0013172292383387685, 0.0, -0.011305673979222775, 0.0, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -0.0013335392577573657, -0.00036459474358707666, -0.0018982740584760904, -0.2098516970872879, 0.0, -2.50339189733495e-06, 0.0, 0.0, -1.1920928244535389e-07, 0.0, 0.0, -0.12044722586870193, -0.5213214159011841, -0.042387425899505615, -0.12491823732852936, -0.007513833697885275, -0.938024640083313, -0.014168502762913704, -0.5338395237922668, -0.0020872014574706554, -0.11926712095737457, -0.7138820886611938, -0.007466032635420561, -0.1305464804172516, 0.0, 0.0, -0.5085117816925049, 0.0, -0.938652515411377, -0.05907667800784111, -0.0004096384218428284, -7.152531907195225e-06, 0.0, -0.01487004105001688, -0.6345874667167664, -1.2134158611297607, -0.7105437517166138, -0.00129270413890481], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "Ste": -0.5725385546684265, "el": 0.0, "work": -0.023250805214047432, "ers": 0.0, "▁at": -0.007913783192634583, "▁Port": -0.0014497257070615888, "▁Tal": 0.0, "bot": 0.0, "▁are": -0.545606255531311, "▁being": -0.6176339983940125, "▁asked": -0.011570490896701813, "▁to": -0.938652515411377, "▁accept": -0.0001486429391661659, "▁a": -0.6345874667167664, "▁less": -0.0013305629836395383, "▁gener": 0.0, "ous": 0.0, "▁p": 0.0, "ension": 0.0, "▁in": -0.12053018808364868, "▁return": -0.0013172292383387685, "▁for": 0.0, "▁future": -0.011305673979222775, "▁invest": 0.0, "ment": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "▁on": -0.0013335392577573657, "▁site": -0.00036459474358707666, ".": -0.0018982740584760904, "##": -2.50339189733495e-06, "#": 0.0, "Art": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "▁The": -0.12044722586870193, "▁UK": -0.5213214159011841, "▁government": -0.7105437517166138, "▁is": -0.12491823732852936, "▁ask": -0.938024640083313, "▁the": -0.007466032635420561, "▁European": -0.5338395237922668, "▁Union": -0.0020872014574706554, "▁extend": -0.7138820886611938, "▁Bre": -0.1305464804172516, "x": 0.0, "it": 0.0, "▁dead": -0.5085117816925049, "line": 0.0, "▁June": -0.05907667800784111, "▁": -0.0004096384218428284, "3": -7.152531907195225e-06, "0": 0.0, ",": -0.01487004105001688, "▁senior": -1.2134158611297607, "▁source": -0.00129270413890481}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

The hubbub around the door and signs in the window handwritten in Arabic script indicate that arrivals from the Middle East are still coming to Serbia's capital. Inside, there is organised chaos. On the ground floor, young men lounge awkwardly in hard-backed chairs, waiting for their turn on the computers lined up on one side of the room. Those in front of the machines don headsets and hold ebullient Skype conversations. Upstairs, the atmosphere is completely different. Bewildered-looking families gather in a stuffy \"safe space\" operated by Save The Children. Parents usher their children over to a pile of toys, while a small boy cries inconsolably. The distinctive aroma of the refugee trail - damp, unwashed clothes - begins to fill the room. \"They are Yazidi people from Iraq,\" says Marjan, a translator struggling to find a common language with the new arrivals. There are more than two dozen people in this extended family group. They did not follow the classic route to Serbia via Greece and Macedonia, but came over the country's eastern border with Bulgaria. In the centre's strip-lighted, windowless meeting room, the overflowing ashtrays and half-drunk mugs of Turkish coffee suggest that it has been a stressful morning. The centre's manager, Vladimir Sjekloca, breaks off to explain the situation. \"There are always people in Belgrade,\" he says. \"Around 400-500 a day.\" Vladimir says the increasing restrictions imposed by countries along the Balkan route - and finally its official closure (although hundreds of people have found a way through the border fence to cross from Greece into Macedonia) - have not stopped people seeking a way to western Europe. They have just changed the means. \"Coming in through Bulgaria - it's an old smuggling route and it'll be used more often. The Afghans tell us, 'It's cheaper to come that way [than the sea crossing from Turkey to Greece] and anyway we can't swim.'\" Before its closure, countries along the route had been co-ordinating transport so that people would be taken from Macedonia to Slovenia's border with Austria on officially provided trains and buses. It was a reasonably smooth process which greatly reduced the possibility of refugees falling into the hands of people smugglers. But now people who are desperate or determined to reach western Europe are once again dealing with unscrupulous elements. \"The journey through Bulgaria is full of ill-treatment,\" says Vladimir. \"People suffer at the hands of the mafia and people smugglers - and they don't get protection from the system. In fact, they can get ill-treated by the Bulgarian police or put in jail. They have set dogs on refugees - we've seen people with dog bites who've been severely beaten by the mafia or the police.\" Some of the people at the Asylum Information Centre have learned the hard way that people smugglers and even the authorities may not have their best interests at heart.

Sensing he was \"seriously traumatised\", the Queen asked if she could help before calling for her corgis. He told Desert Island Discs the dogs had a therapeutic effect. The surgeon, who volunteers with Medecins Sans Frontieres and the International Committee of the Red Cross, said the Queen's humanity was \"unbelievable\" and described her as \"warm and wonderful\". Dr Nott told the BBC Radio 4 programme that he had been operating on \"badly damaged\" children from a makeshift theatre in the Syrian city and key battleground of Aleppo, and he did not know what to say to the Queen when it was his turn to speak. For more than two decades, Dr Nott - a consultant surgeon at Royal Marsden, St Mary's and Chelsea and Westminster Hospitals in London - has given up several months every year to volunteer in war zones and amid major humanitarian crises. He has performed life-saving surgery in Afghanistan, Bosnia, Iraq, Libya, Pakistan and Syria. During Desert Island Discs he recalled meeting the Queen at a private lunch at Buckingham Palace in October 2014. Dr Nott - who admitted that he suffered from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder as a result of his work in war zones - said: \"I [had been] coping [in Syria] with children that were really badly damaged and she must have detected something significant. \"I didn't know what to say. It wasn't that I didn't want to speak to her - I just couldn't. I just could not say anything. \"She picked all this up and said, 'Well, shall I help you?' I thought, 'How on earth can the Queen help me?' \"All of a sudden the courtiers brought the corgis and the corgis went underneath the table.\" Dr Nott said the Queen then opened a tin of biscuits and invited him to feed and stroke the dogs. He added: \"And so for 20 minutes during this lunch the Queen and I fed the dogs. She did it because she knew that I was so seriously traumatised. You know the humanity of what she was doing was unbelievable.\" During the programme, Dr Nott also recalled the moment when he was operating on a man and six armed militants from so-called Islamic State (IS) burst into the room. Dr Nott said he was too scared to speak for fear that the militants would recognise he was British. \"I remember so vividly my legs shaking like jelly, and they stayed in for about 20 minutes with their guns all pointing towards us, then all of a sudden something happened outside... and they left,\" he said. Earlier this year, Dr Nott was named winner of the Robert Burns Humanitarian Award 2016. He also set up the David Nott Foundation which offers other surgeons and medical professionals training and advice on how to help in conflict and natural disaster zones around the world.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nA surgeon who volunteers with Medecins Sans Frontieres and the International Committee of the Red Cross has said that the Queen was \"warm and wonderful\" when he met her at Buckingham Palace.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "A", "▁sur", "geon", "▁who", "▁volunte", "ers", "▁with", "▁Med", "ec", "ins", "▁Sans", "▁Front", "ier", "es", "▁and", "▁the", "▁International", "▁Committee", "▁of", "▁the", "▁Red", "▁Cross", "▁has", "▁said", "▁that", "▁the", "▁Queen", "▁was", "▁\"", "w", "arm", "▁and", "▁wonderful", "\"", "▁when", "▁he", "▁met", "▁her", "▁at", "▁Buck", "ingham", "▁Palace", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁The", "▁Duch", "ess", "▁of", "▁Cambridge", "▁has", "▁been", "▁named", "▁the", "▁patron", "▁of", "▁the"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.0032815674785524607, -0.008856656961143017, 0.0, -0.004617741797119379, -0.0789836049079895, 0.0, -0.1931414008140564, -0.0013444918440654874, 0.0, 0.0, -1.5497195136049413e-06, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.00038961926475167274, -2.3841855067985307e-07, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.03132983669638634, -0.4239226281642914, -0.5206418633460999, -0.01804998330771923, 0.0, -0.795484721660614, -0.0030999958980828524, -0.3609212040901184, -0.00036459474358707666, -8.583032467868179e-06, 0.0, -1.6689286894688848e-06, -0.046831920742988586, -0.29313212633132935, -0.0020096360240131617, -2.7418097943154862e-06, -0.002529280725866556, -0.5063583850860596, 0.0, 0.0, -0.004547373857349157, -0.023744629696011543, 0.0, -0.001947531825862825, 0.0, 0.0, -4.768370445162873e-07, 0.0, 0.0, -0.09163321554660797, -0.2821612060070038, 0.0, -3.576278118089249e-07, -0.08833243697881699, -0.20506247878074646, -0.2730644941329956, -0.0773615688085556, -0.26429182291030884, -0.09268610924482346, -2.3841855067985307e-07, -0.2128135859966278], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "A": -0.0032815674785524607, "▁sur": -0.008856656961143017, "geon": 0.0, "▁who": -0.004617741797119379, "▁volunte": -0.0789836049079895, "ers": 0.0, "▁with": -0.1931414008140564, "▁Med": -0.0013444918440654874, "ec": 0.0, "ins": 0.0, "▁Sans": -1.5497195136049413e-06, "▁Front": 0.0, "ier": 0.0, "es": 0.0, "▁and": -8.583032467868179e-06, "▁the": -0.2128135859966278, "▁International": 0.0, "▁Committee": 0.0, "▁of": -2.3841855067985307e-07, "▁Red": 0.0, "▁Cross": 0.0, "▁has": -0.20506247878074646, "▁said": -0.4239226281642914, "▁that": -0.5206418633460999, "▁Queen": 0.0, "▁was": -0.795484721660614, "▁\"": -0.0030999958980828524, "w": -0.3609212040901184, "arm": -0.00036459474358707666, "▁wonderful": 0.0, "\"": -1.6689286894688848e-06, "▁when": -0.046831920742988586, "▁he": -0.29313212633132935, "▁met": -0.0020096360240131617, "▁her": -2.7418097943154862e-06, "▁at": -0.002529280725866556, "▁Buck": -0.5063583850860596, "ingham": 0.0, "▁Palace": 0.0, ".": -0.004547373857349157, "##": -0.001947531825862825, "#": 0.0, "Art": -4.768370445162873e-07, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "▁The": -0.09163321554660797, "▁Duch": -0.2821612060070038, "ess": 0.0, "▁Cambridge": -0.08833243697881699, "▁been": -0.2730644941329956, "▁named": -0.0773615688085556, "▁patron": -0.09268610924482346}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

The Australian Broadcasting Corp. quoted Sophia's grandmother, Vera Cook, who credited the dog with saving the toddler's life. She said that Sophia was wearing just a nappy and T-shirt when she wandered off. \"The only thing I was thinking was well, hopefully the dog would have kept her warm,\" Ms Cook was quoted as saying. \"If [the dog] wasn't with her, I don't know whether they would have found her.\" The family issued a statement thanking emergency services and promising that Poppy would be \"well fed this evening\".\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\nA pet dog is being credited with keeping a little girl safe after the pair wandered away from their family home and could not be found for hours.\n\n###\nArticle: The soap star confirmed her living situation on Twitter, saying that she's had a tough year and had \"lost\" her home. \"I have the love of my kids and a few good friends,\" she said. She last appeared in the BBC One soap in 2010, playing the role of Sam Mitchell. Ms Westbrook says she spoke out because someone was trying to sell a story about it to a magazine. The 41-year-old first appeared on Albert Square in 1990 but left in 1996. She had a brief second stint in the show between 1999 and 2000. In 2002, she was replaced in the role by another actress, Kim Medcalf, who left EastEnders in 2005. Ms Westbrook then returned to the role in 2009. Ms Westbrook has previously dealt with cocaine addiction. She was one of the contestants in I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! in 2003 but left the competition because she feared it was interfering with her recovery. \"I was living hour to hour in a world of hurt and thought, 'I've got to go to an AA meeting and centre myself',\" she said in a later interview.

However, said Colby Moore from security firm Synack, the way it passes data around is \"fundamentally broken\" making it vulnerable to attack. Globalstar has not yet issued any comment on Mr Moore's findings. Mr Moore said the problems with Globalstar's network arise because it does not encrypt the data passing between devices and satellites. Instead, he said, the system attempts to conceal what it does by changing frequencies and padding transmissions with useless data. The system also does not check that data was coming from where it claimed, he said. \"I ended up figuring out how to decode the data in transit,\" Mr Moore told Reuters, adding that it might prove hard to fix the flaws as existing hardware was not easy to update. Globalstar has been told about the flaws, he added, but so far has not issued any updates or fixes. Attackers can easily find out these flaws, he said, making it easy to spoof data or keep an eye on assets being tracked. Organised crime gangs, police and intelligence agencies might already be listening in, he said. Mr Moore is planning to release more details about his work at the Black Hat hacker conference in Las Vegas next week. This month has seen the early release of other investigations into the security of cars and Android phones that will also feature at Black Hat. Earlier this week, security experts from Zimpherium released some information about a vulnerability that affected almost one billion Android handsets. Google has produced a patch for the bug but many handsets have yet to have it applied. Last week, in separate demonstrations, Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek from security firm IOActive and Andy Davis from the UK's NCC Group showed how it was possible to attack some makes of car via their entertainment systems. The IOActive work led car maker Chrysler to issue a recall of more than 1.4 million vehicles to patch the software hole.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nA security researcher has found a way to hack into satellite-based tracking systems used by companies to monitor their vehicles and other assets. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "A", "▁security", "▁research", "er", "▁has", "▁found", "▁a", "▁way", "▁to", "▁hack", "▁into", "▁satellite", "-", "based", "▁tracking", "▁systems", "▁used", "▁by", "▁companies", "▁to", "▁monitor", "▁their", "▁vehicles", "▁and", "▁other", "▁assets", ".", "▁", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.0015538772568106651, -0.007924309000372887, -0.2519705593585968, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -0.00230404338799417, -0.02454022318124771, -0.8181148767471313, -1.1161465644836426, -6.007967749610543e-05, -0.41402667760849, -0.0016338583081960678, -0.5650308132171631, -0.023485230281949043, -4.637133679352701e-05, -0.04250956326723099, -0.05274378880858421, -0.019004639238119125, -0.0236185472458601, -0.5953111052513123, -0.006377227138727903, -0.3773811459541321, -0.991157054901123, -0.3756771385669708, -0.5385334491729736, -0.03537233546376228, -0.0008551992941647768, -0.06414342671632767, -0.5295639038085938, -1.0728830375228426e-06, 0.0, -0.38819003105163574, -0.006834108382463455, -0.011343155056238174, -0.001342110801488161, -0.0030285704415291548, -0.00013481661153491586, -8.892617915989831e-05, -1.8715683836489916e-05, -5.006777428206988e-06, -3.2186455882765586e-06, -2.9802276912960224e-06, -1.311301275563892e-06, -1.7881377516459906e-06, -1.0728830375228426e-06, -7.152555099310121e-07, -4.768370445162873e-07, -3.576278118089249e-07, -4.768370445162873e-07, -2.3841855067985307e-07, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -1.1920928244535389e-07, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "A": -0.0015538772568106651, "▁security": -0.007924309000372887, "▁research": -0.2519705593585968, "er": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "▁has": -0.00230404338799417, "▁found": -0.02454022318124771, "▁a": -0.8181148767471313, "▁way": -1.1161465644836426, "▁to": -0.006377227138727903, "▁hack": -0.41402667760849, "▁into": -0.0016338583081960678, "▁satellite": -0.5650308132171631, "-": -0.023485230281949043, "based": -4.637133679352701e-05, "▁tracking": -0.04250956326723099, "▁systems": -0.05274378880858421, "▁used": -0.019004639238119125, "▁by": -0.0236185472458601, "▁companies": -0.5953111052513123, "▁monitor": -0.3773811459541321, "▁their": -0.991157054901123, "▁vehicles": -0.3756771385669708, "▁and": -0.5385334491729736, "▁other": -0.03537233546376228, "▁assets": -0.0008551992941647768, ".": -0.06414342671632767, "▁": -0.5295639038085938}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

What next? Kiss-cams. Mexican waves. Pitch-side microphone-wielding fun police ordering everybody to 'MAKE SOME NOISE!' Too late, alas. Too late. Those who are against bonus points for extra scores see it is a gimmick that will do nothing to enhance a tournament that doesn't need a whole lot of enhancing in the first place. Apply a retrospective bonus-point system and would it have changed the finishing order in 2016? No. How about 2015, 2014? No, no. Are there not enough tries in the Six Nations already? Not as many as its southern hemisphere counterpart, the Rugby Championship, but enough to satisfy the vast crowds who always turn up to watch it? The average try count per match in the 2016 Six Nations was 4.73. In the Rugby Championship it was 5.83. The season before it was 4.13 in the north and 5.5 in the south. The season before that, 4.07 in the Six Nations and 4.17 in the Rugby Championship. It's not as big a gulf as people might think. In any event, Six Nations rugby is not Rugby Championship rugby. It has its own heartbeat. Oftentimes, it's rugby in the trenches. Full Metal Jacket stuff. It's not as easy on the eye as the New Zealands and the Australias, but it works. And fans adore it. In the southern hemisphere's four-nation tournament, yes, there are more tries, but does that necessarily make it better, more intoxicating? Across a difficult four-year period in economic terms, Six Nations crowds have gone from an average of 69,531 to 68,968, a drop of less than 1%. That's good going in the climate. The Rugby Championship's crowds are down close to 12%. The opposing, pro-change view is that the Six Nations has become a bit tired and is in need of modernising. The Rugby Championship, the Champions Cup, the Premiership in England, the Pro12, the Top 14 in France and Super Rugby in the southern hemisphere all have the bonus-point system. In the Six Nations there is a view that the premium is on defence over attack. That argument can be overblown, but there's truth in it, too. Those who are supportive of the new bonus-point system see a vision of the future that will have a nation busting a gut to turn three tries into four in the latter stages of a Test, just to secure that extra point. Cue more attacking intent and more entertainment. That's the wish. For example, in the 2015 Six Nations, had England scored four tries against Scotland - and got a bonus point - instead of three they might have won the championship. The winners, Ireland, could apply the same logic to one of their games, of course. So could Wales. In 2014, had England added to their two first-half tries in their victory against Wales with another two in the second half\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nThe Six Nations is considering changing its bonus point system, which would make it more similar to the Rugby Championship .  \n\n[INST] Write a title for this article: The 2017 Six Nations Championship is the 126th season of the Six Nations, the premier rugby union tournament i", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "The", "▁Six", "▁Nations", "▁is", "▁considering", "▁changing", "▁its", "▁bonus", "▁point", "▁system", ",", "▁which", "▁would", "▁make", "▁it", "▁more", "▁similar", "▁to", "▁the", "▁Rugby", "▁Championship", "▁.", "▁▁", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "[", "INST", "]", "▁Write", "▁a", "▁title", "▁for", "▁this", "▁article", ":", "▁The", "▁", "2", "0", "1", "7", "▁Six", "▁Nations", "▁Championship", "▁is", "▁the", "▁", "1", "2", "6", "th", "▁season", "▁of", "▁the", "▁Six", "▁Nations", ",", "▁the", "▁premier", "▁rugby", "▁union", "▁tournament", "▁in"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.14590458571910858, -0.022107817232608795, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -0.06962738931179047, -0.34407898783683777, -0.9212507009506226, -0.17324276268482208, -0.2812744677066803, -0.14868168532848358, -0.00013243274588603526, -0.08906890451908112, -0.0128819914534688, -0.08986259251832962, -0.3063153326511383, -0.007201665081083775, -0.00063744728686288, -0.6932191848754883, 0.0, -0.003485914785414934, -0.0018565100617706776, -0.00016759421851020306, -0.48549512028694153, -0.642693281173706, 0.0, 0.0, -0.007910826243460178, 0.0, 0.0, -0.4722940921783447, -0.015410985797643661, -0.0010845737997442484, -2.3841855067985307e-07, -0.00036459474358707666, -0.0003657863999251276, 0.0, -0.6579460501670837, -0.8292747139930725, -0.17802143096923828, -0.0001081169830285944, -0.0012734169140458107, -0.38852164149284363, -0.12526683509349823, 0.0, -0.8016156554222107, -0.541914701461792, -3.313963316031732e-05, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -0.00010442188795423135, -3.4927710657939315e-05, -1.5616295058862306e-05, 0.0, -0.21387767791748047, 0.0, -0.00764006981626153, -0.5388866662979126, 0.0, -0.0036069590132683516, -0.12581726908683777, -0.1250583678483963, -0.7897387146949768, -2.861018856492592e-06, -0.5376211404800415, -0.025487776845693588], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "The": -0.14590458571910858, "▁Six": -0.5388866662979126, "▁Nations": 0.0, "▁is": -0.541914701461792, "▁considering": -0.34407898783683777, "▁changing": -0.9212507009506226, "▁its": -0.17324276268482208, "▁bonus": -0.2812744677066803, "▁point": -0.14868168532848358, "▁system": -0.00013243274588603526, ",": -0.0036069590132683516, "▁which": -0.0128819914534688, "▁would": -0.08986259251832962, "▁make": -0.3063153326511383, "▁it": -0.007201665081083775, "▁more": -0.00063744728686288, "▁similar": -0.6932191848754883, "▁to": 0.0, "▁the": -0.12581726908683777, "▁Rugby": -0.0018565100617706776, "▁Championship": -0.8016156554222107, "▁.": -0.48549512028694153, "▁▁": -0.642693281173706, "[": -0.007910826243460178, "INST": 0.0, "]": 0.0, "▁Write": -0.4722940921783447, "▁a": -0.015410985797643661, "▁title": -0.0010845737997442484, "▁for": -2.3841855067985307e-07, "▁this": -0.00036459474358707666, "▁article": -0.0003657863999251276, ":": 0.0, "▁The": -0.6579460501670837, "▁": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "2": -3.4927710657939315e-05, "0": -0.0001081169830285944, "1": -0.00010442188795423135, "7": -0.38852164149284363, "6": -1.5616295058862306e-05, "th": 0.0, "▁season": -0.21387767791748047, "▁of": 0.0, "▁premier": -0.1250583678483963, "▁rugby": -0.7897387146949768, "▁union": -2.861018856492592e-06, "▁tournament": -0.5376211404800415, "▁in": -0.025487776845693588}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

Residents from flats above the takeaway escaped without injury. Other premises on the street have been damaged. The police said, at this stage, they were not treating the incident as a hate crime. SDLP councillor Thomas Burns said it was unclear what had actually happened but it looked like the car had been rammed against the shutter of the restaurant. \"This is an absolute disgrace,\" he said. \"Whether this vehicle has been moved or burnt and has been rammed against the shutters of this takeaway, for the people living upstairs, it could have been an absolute disaster. \"If the blaze had got going, if the people had not got out, the smoke could have killed them, never mind the fire. \"I'm horrified that these Chinese people have been targeted. Why it was them, is a question that is being asked.\" Councillor Mervyn Rea of the Ulster Unionist Party said: \"That vehicle could have exploded, it could have caused damage where it was parked, it could have caused injury to anyone on the street and, equally so, when it propelled into the shop and set the shop ablaze. \"It could have caused a nasty accident when it was veering across the street.\" Anne-Marie Logue, Sinn FÃ©in councillor, said people in the area were \"aghast as to why this has happened\". \"We are very annoyed for the business involved as well and the family are devastated,\" she said. \"It's obviously put them out of business for quite a few weeks. \"Opportunists decided to break into the car. The car was put on fire and unfortunately it was directed towards this shop. I'm just glad that nobody has been hurt.\" She said Â£700,000 had recently been invested to upgrade Crumlin Main Street.

A law to change the name is expected to pass before the 2021 election. Presiding Officer Elin Jones hoped people would \"more fully understand the powers of the assembly and the role it plays in their lives\". But Neil Hamilton, UKIP AM, expressed concerns over potential costs. The assembly was given the power to rename itself under the 2017 Wales Act. Assembly members had unanimously backed the idea last July after which it was put out to public consultation. Publishing the responses on Tuesday, Ms Jones said: \"Our role today is as a full parliamentary body, with the power to pass laws and agree taxes, and we must continue to work hard to inspire the confidence, trust and pride in the people we serve.\" Speaking to BBC Wales, Ms Jones said the Welsh Parliament name will \"reflect directly the will of the people of Wales in giving us the mandate to have the powers to create legislation on their behalf\". \"We are a parliament in all but name,\" she said. Sixty percent of people responding to the consultation said they did not agree that the role of the assembly was well understood. Just over a fifth of respondents - 22.6% - who responded to the survey said they strongly disagreed or disagreed with the assembly's name changing. Legislation on assembly reforms - including the change of name - will be published by the Assembly Commission in 2018. They will include rules on disqualification of assembly members and the design of the committee system. The commission proposes that assembly members will in future be known as Welsh Parliament Members (WPMs), in keeping with the current title of Assembly Members. The option was the second least-favoured option according to a summary of the survey conducted for the consultation - with 11.1% of respondents preferring it over other suggestions. Member of the Welsh Parliament was preferred by 30% while 28.4% liked Member of the Senedd. Tory AM Suzy Davies, Assembly Commissioner with responsibility for budget and governance, said the assembly would not \"waste resources by rushing to make the change\", noting that some people responding to the consultation were worried about the cost.

Mrs Whitehouse, he says, \"confused reality with an illusion\" on the stage. If he had been convicted, Bogdanov could have been jailed for up to three years. Written by the playwright Howard Brenton, The Romans in Britain, which opened in London in October 1980, was always likely to provoke controversy. With vivid imagery, strong language and violence, the play sought to draw graphic parallels between the Romans' invasion of the British Isles and the presence at the time of British soldiers on the streets of Northern Ireland. But it was one short scene involving the attempted rape of a young Druid called Marban by a Roman soldier (\"a metaphor for the rape of one culture by another,\" according to the director), that eventually landed Bogdanov in court. When he was first handed the play by the National's then artistic director, Sir Peter Hall, Bogdanov says he thought it contained some of the best new writing he had read. The attempted rape scene, to be performed with naked actors in full light and centre-stage, was \"brilliantly written\". But though nudity was not uncommon on the stage - and Bogdanov was careful that no sexual contact was actually made between the actors (the Roman used his bunched up fist and thumb as a substitute for his erect penis) - Sir Peter was clearly worried. He asked Bogdanov to consider moving the scene upstage, in half light. The director stood his ground, arguing the scene's artistic merit. Sir Peter eventually acceded, but not before warning that there could be trouble ahead. Though playing to packed audiences, the play's nudity and strong language attracted fervent media attention. But more ominously, it quickly came to the notice of Mrs Whitehouse, then head of the National Viewers and Listeners' Association. She refused to attend a performance in person but in December 1980 sent her solicitor to watch the play in order to collect evidence. He came back convinced there had been a sexual act on stage likely to cause offence. Listen to the programme Download the podcast Having tried and failed to force the Attorney General to initiate a prosecution against the National, the morality campaigner then began her own proceedings under the 1956 Sexual Offences Act, accusing Bogdanov of being the \"pimp\" who had allegedly procured the act on stage. Three decades on, Bogdanov's memories of those days are still vivid.

But under new European regulations, supported by Britain's Food Standards Agency (FSA), they will have to rely on visual checks alone. The FSA says the new system avoids the risk of harmful bacteria being spread. Around eight million pigs a year are slaughtered for meat in the UK. Ron Spellman, a British meat inspector with 30 years' experience, says the new regulations, which took effect from 1 June, risk diseased parts of animals going undetected. Listen to Allan Urry's report on File on Four on BBC Radio 4 at 20:00 BST on Tuesday 17 June, or catch up on the BBC iPlayer Mr Spellman, who is director general of the European Working community for Food inspectors and Consumer protection (EWFC), which represents meat inspectors across the EU, said: \"Last year we know that there were at least 37,000 pigs' heads with abscesses or tuberculosis lesions in lymph nodes in the head. They won't be cut now. \"There's no way to see those little abscesses, little tuberculosis lesions without cutting those lymph nodes.\" Meat from pigs' heads, is recovered by specialised parts of boning plants and goes into pies, sausages and other processed foods. The new regulations have been drawn up by the European Food Safety Authority, an agency funded by the EU, but they are based on scientific advice from the FSA. The FSA's chief operating officer Andrew Rhodes told the BBC it was better to have a hands-off system using visual checks to reduce cross-contamination, because bugs like E. coli and campylobacter are causing scientists more concern. He said: \"The risks to the consumers are increasingly from microbiological and pathogenic hazards and that's what we must control. \"We cannot simply ignore the risks that are brought by touching, cutting and handling products that are later going to go on to be cooked and eaten, we have to do this properly.\" But the FSA's support for the new measures puts them at odds with many of their own frontline staff, the 1,100 meat inspectors who check safety standards in Britain's 350 slaughterhouses and in meat-cutting plants which process carcasses. Some in the slaughtering industry are also opposing the changes. Kevin Burrows, of C and K Meats, owns an abattoir in Suffolk whose main business is pork. He sees the new hands-off approach as \"a backward step\" and says his customers in Asian markets still insist on their pork being checked in the old way, which the FSA has agreed to allow him to do. But he says: \"Why should an exported product be under higher scrutiny than a British product? We'll end up with a two-tier system.\" Shadow food and farming minister Huw Irranca-Davies has called for an urgent meeting with the FSA. He says he is not convinced by the science he has seen on the matter and is worried the new rules could damage Britain's exports, which rely on a reputation for high welfare and meat hygiene standards.

Her reputation has been dented by a corruption scandal, known as Cashgate, which has led donors to cut aid. Her main challengers are Mr Mutharika's brother, Peter, Atupele Muluzi - the son of another former president - and a former preacher, Lazarus Chakwera. By Chakuchanya HarawaBBC Africa, Blantyre Competitive election Mr Chakwera is the candidate of the Malawi Congress Party, which governed from independence in 1964 until the first multi-party poll in 1994. Voting was delayed in parts of the largest city, Blantyre, due to a shortage of election material. \"There's no ink. We're still waiting for the consignment,\" one of the officials told the crowd, reports the Reuters news agency. There are reports of angry scenes at some polling stations. But in the capital, Lilongwe, voting mostly started on time, Reuters reports. Mrs Banda has denied any wrong-doing in relation to Cashgate and last week told the BBC that the fact the affair has gone to court was her \"greatest achievement\" because in the past, such scandals would have been covered up. Scores of officials, including former ministers, have been arrested over the scandal, often with large amounts of cash. Up to $250m (Â£150m) may have been lost through allegedly fraudulent payments. Analysts say that despite the close race, she is likely to win because of her popularity in rural areas. The candidate with the most votes is declared the winner of the presidential race - there is no run-off. There is a total of 12 presidential candidates. Parliamentary and local elections are being held at the same time. Malawi is one the poorest countries in the world and is heavily dependent on aid, with donors proving 40% of the budget.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nMalawi goes to the polls on Thursday in a presidential election seen as a test of President Joyce Banda's leadership and of the country's democracy . \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "Mal", "aw", "i", "▁goes", "▁to", "▁the", "▁pol", "ls", "▁on", "▁Th", "urs", "day", "▁in", "▁a", "▁president", "ial", "▁election", "▁seen", "▁as", "▁a", "▁test", "▁of", "▁President", "▁Joy", "ce", "▁Band", "a", "'", "s", "▁leadership", "▁and", "▁of", "▁the", "▁country", "'", "s", "▁dem", "ocracy", "▁.", "▁", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.26433902978897095, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -0.010406753048300743, -0.4517710208892822, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -1.6689286894688848e-06, 0.0, 0.0, -0.7619063258171082, -0.3709540367126465, -1.1920928244535389e-07, 0.0, -0.43357571959495544, -0.047001175582408905, -0.005753741133958101, 0.0, -0.00032646095496602356, -0.4449464678764343, -5.602820692729438e-06, -0.008543843403458595, -0.0694296732544899, -0.023245446383953094, -0.2536478340625763, -4.589452510117553e-05, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -1.3589766240329482e-05, 0.0, -0.3615429699420929, -0.7135644555091858, -0.8282737731933594, -0.03586078807711601, -0.017404211685061455, 0.0, 0.0, -0.04726307466626167, -0.2519291341304779, -0.3716453015804291, -0.3717949092388153, 0.0, 0.0, -0.024153269827365875, -0.0029856651090085506, -0.0010875507723540068, -8.940297266235575e-05, -0.0019894109573215246, -9.893881360767409e-05, -0.0001147919538198039, -3.969590397900902e-05, -1.4185804502631072e-05, -1.0251946150674485e-05, -4.410734163684538e-06, -4.172316494077677e-06, -4.0531076592742465e-06, -2.622600959512056e-06, -1.7881377516459906e-06, -1.7881377516459906e-06, -1.0728830375228426e-06, -7.152555099310121e-07, -4.768370445162873e-07, -3.576278118089249e-07, -2.3841855067985307e-07], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": -2.3841855067985307e-07, "Mal": -0.26433902978897095, "aw": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "i": -0.010406753048300743, "▁goes": -0.4517710208892822, "▁to": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "▁the": -0.03586078807711601, "▁pol": 0.0, "ls": 0.0, "▁on": -0.7619063258171082, "▁Th": -0.3709540367126465, "urs": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "day": 0.0, "▁in": -0.43357571959495544, "▁a": -0.008543843403458595, "▁president": -0.005753741133958101, "ial": 0.0, "▁election": -0.00032646095496602356, "▁seen": -0.4449464678764343, "▁as": -5.602820692729438e-06, "▁test": -0.0694296732544899, "▁of": -0.8282737731933594, "▁President": -0.2536478340625763, "▁Joy": -4.589452510117553e-05, "ce": 0.0, "▁Band": 0.0, "a": 0.0, "'": 0.0, "s": 0.0, "▁leadership": -0.3615429699420929, "▁and": -0.7135644555091858, "▁country": -0.017404211685061455, "▁dem": -0.04726307466626167, "ocracy": -0.2519291341304779, "▁.": -0.3716453015804291, "▁": -0.3717949092388153}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

Present owner Ann Budge had proposed delaying the repayment of her £2.5m investment to help fund the project. Following a vote of foundation members, only 43 were against the proposal and 3,790 in favour. Hearts said on their website: \"We are absolutely delighted that the foundation members have given such a resounding vote in favour of the offer from Ann Budge. \"This significant milestone on the road to the 'new' Tynecastle once more demonstrates our collective strength.\" Hearts hope to fund the new stand via £3m from club reserves, £2.5m from benefactor contributions, £0.5m from commercial contributions, which leaves a shortfall of £6m once the club adds a contingency for an increase in costs. The Scottish Premiership club hope to build up further reserves and launch a new debenture scheme, but the delay of up to two years in the Foundation of Hearts buying Budge's stake will allow funds to go directly into the club in the meantime. \"Assuming contributions continued at today's levels, majority ownership would pass to FOH only eight months later than originally envisaged,\" Hearts have stated. Full planning permission is still required from City of Edinburgh Council, but Hearts have already planned out the progress of the two-year project that will result in a stadium with a capacity up to 21,000. To prepare for the building of the new stand, the buildings behind the current stand - the administration block, the shop and nursery - would be knocked down, with temporary facilities being provided during construction. The temporary buildings will be occupied in October, with the demolition beginning the following month. Construction of the new stand will start over and behind the current stand during next season before being completed during the 2017 close season.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nA Scottish Premiership club has announced plans to build a new stand at its stadium, with a capacity of up to 21,000.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "A", "▁Scottish", "▁Prem", "iers", "hip", "▁club", "▁has", "▁announced", "▁plans", "▁to", "▁build", "▁a", "▁new", "▁stand", "▁at", "▁its", "▁stad", "ium", ",", "▁with", "▁a", "▁capacity", "▁of", "▁up", "▁to", "▁", "2", "1", ",", "0", "0", "0", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁The", "▁", "2", "0", "1", "6", "▁Copa", "▁América", "▁Cent", "enario", "▁was", "▁the", "▁", "4", "5", "th", "▁edition", "▁of", "▁the", "▁Copa", "▁América", ","], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.11408846825361252, -0.26230791211128235, -0.17598167061805725, 0.0, 0.0, -0.00016759421851020306, -0.9627308249473572, -0.47053176164627075, -0.5476651191711426, -0.17300845682621002, -0.005673970561474562, -4.768370445162873e-07, -1.6212332411669195e-05, -0.015404412522912025, -0.11959115415811539, -0.702399492263794, -0.035178083926439285, 0.0, -0.14010487496852875, -0.12459276616573334, -0.11880823969841003, -0.001627312507480383, -0.25193190574645996, -0.0012730597518384457, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.6147025227546692, -0.5284857749938965, 0.0, -0.0019545515533536673, 0.0, 0.0, -7.152555099310121e-07, 0.0, 0.0, -0.08865257352590561, -0.11356835812330246, -0.14700840413570404, -0.038094889372587204, -0.004470592364668846, -0.8927894234657288, -1.159421682357788, -0.5199427008628845, -0.11928638070821762, 0.0, -0.0031342213042080402, -0.017284005880355835, -0.004435819108039141, -0.07890946418046951, -0.05276583880186081, 0.0, -5.8530047681415454e-05, 0.0, -0.0005540504935197532, -9.011816291604191e-05, 0.0, -6.318072337307967e-06], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "A": -0.11408846825361252, "▁Scottish": -0.26230791211128235, "▁Prem": -0.17598167061805725, "iers": 0.0, "hip": 0.0, "▁club": -0.00016759421851020306, "▁has": -0.9627308249473572, "▁announced": -0.47053176164627075, "▁plans": -0.5476651191711426, "▁to": 0.0, "▁build": -0.005673970561474562, "▁a": -0.11880823969841003, "▁new": -1.6212332411669195e-05, "▁stand": -0.015404412522912025, "▁at": -0.11959115415811539, "▁its": -0.702399492263794, "▁stad": -0.035178083926439285, "ium": 0.0, ",": -6.318072337307967e-06, "▁with": -0.12459276616573334, "▁capacity": -0.001627312507480383, "▁of": 0.0, "▁up": -0.0012730597518384457, "▁": -0.004435819108039141, "2": -0.14700840413570404, "1": -0.004470592364668846, "0": -0.038094889372587204, ".": -0.6147025227546692, "##": -0.0019545515533536673, "#": 0.0, "Art": -7.152555099310121e-07, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "▁The": -0.08865257352590561, "6": -0.8927894234657288, "▁Copa": -9.011816291604191e-05, "▁América": 0.0, "▁Cent": -0.11928638070821762, "enario": 0.0, "▁was": -0.0031342213042080402, "▁the": -0.0005540504935197532, "4": -0.07890946418046951, "5": -0.05276583880186081, "th": 0.0, "▁edition": -5.8530047681415454e-05}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

Seventy-nine families have already taken advantage of the initiative to encourage them to take up swimming. The idea has received ??230,000 funding from Sport England's Community Activation Fund. Warrington Borough Council backed community leisure operator LiveWire's application for the money, which finances transport to Great Sankey Leisure Centre - four miles (6km) away from Bewsey and Dallam. Families who have children in three local schools will benefit from free travel for three years. Mike Diaper, Sport England's director of community sport, said: \"We know there is a significant gap between the number of people playing sport for those in low socio-economic groups and those with higher incomes. \"We also know from our insight that there is high demand for sport from people who earn less.\" Councillor Kate Hannon says people in those areas are \"sometimes the forgotten few\". Ms Hannon, who is responsible for leisure at the council, said: \"By providing facilities that they can access it is a stepping stone for them to give them more confidence themselves. \"Dallam has no access to GP services or any other health services.\" A planning application is due to be submitted in August for the demolition of Great Sankey Leisure Centre.

That is down from 6.1% in the previous quarter. Analysts were expecting the same figure for January to March. India is the third-largest economy in Asia but has been struggling with inflation and currency weakness. Since July last year, the Indian rupee has seen one of the biggest declines among Asian currencies, dropping more than 27% against the US dollar. \"Shocking numbers as growth was even lower than lows witnessed during the financial crisis,\" said Anubhuti Sahay from Standard Chartered Bank in Mumbai. The BBC's Yogita Limaye in Mumbai said that just a year ago India was aspiring for double-digit growth. But a global slowdown has reduced external demand, and high inflation coupled with a weak rupee has made things more expensive within the country. Domestic demand, which India's economy is largely reliant on, has also slowed in part due to the political upheaval in the country. India's economy is suffering from \"policy incoherence, shifting global risk appetite and a comatose government\", said Rajeev Malik, senior economist at brokerage CLSA India's Prime Minister Manmohan Singh admitted early this month that his government must do more to get the once fast-growing economy moving again. The Congress-led coalition government is caught up in a slew of corruption scandals. Key policy reforms, including allowing foreign investment in India's retail sector, have been delayed in parliament for more than a year. This has worried foreign investors and threatened the country's investment grade credit rating. \"This is definitely a very important signal for the government - this is a make or break situation for India and the government has to step on the panic button,\" said Rupa Rege Nitsure, chief economist at Bank of Baroda in Mumbai. \"If the government doesn't step in now, India's sovereign ratings may be jeopardised.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nIndia's economy has slowed to its lowest growth rate in more than three years, according to official data . \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "Ind", "ia", "'", "s", "▁economy", "▁has", "▁slow", "ed", "▁to", "▁its", "▁lowest", "▁growth", "▁rate", "▁in", "▁more", "▁than", "▁three", "▁years", ",", "▁according", "▁to", "▁official", "▁data", "▁.", "▁", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.001292823115363717, -1.6689286894688848e-06, -0.00018892886873800308, 0.0, -0.04211898893117905, -1.1126155853271484, -0.5169386267662048, 0.0, -0.7407535910606384, -0.18848446011543274, -0.03851113095879555, -0.1899501383304596, -0.17493760585784912, -0.0350533202290535, -0.6842232346534729, 0.0, -0.6742212176322937, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -0.3896227777004242, -0.9948724508285522, 0.0, -0.6720392107963562, -0.11742544919252396, -0.7096889019012451, -0.41393551230430603, -4.6491513785440475e-06, 0.0, -0.21408940851688385, -0.00020656836568377912, -0.0007048744591884315, -1.7404405298293568e-05, -0.00026079590315930545, -1.0251946150674485e-05, -8.22540732769994e-06, -2.0265558760002023e-06, -1.0728830375228426e-06, -7.152555099310121e-07, -4.768370445162873e-07, -7.152555099310121e-07, -4.768370445162873e-07, -4.768370445162873e-07, -2.3841855067985307e-07, -2.3841855067985307e-07, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -1.1920928244535389e-07, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "Ind": -0.001292823115363717, "ia": -1.6689286894688848e-06, "'": -0.00018892886873800308, "s": 0.0, "▁economy": -0.04211898893117905, "▁has": -1.1126155853271484, "▁slow": -0.5169386267662048, "ed": 0.0, "▁to": 0.0, "▁its": -0.18848446011543274, "▁lowest": -0.03851113095879555, "▁growth": -0.1899501383304596, "▁rate": -0.17493760585784912, "▁in": -0.0350533202290535, "▁more": -0.6842232346534729, "▁than": 0.0, "▁three": -0.6742212176322937, "▁years": -1.1920928244535389e-07, ",": -0.3896227777004242, "▁according": -0.9948724508285522, "▁official": -0.6720392107963562, "▁data": -0.11742544919252396, "▁.": -0.7096889019012451, "▁": -0.41393551230430603}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

Her late brother, Sir Michael Havers, was attorney general in the 1980s. Home Secretary Theresa May said she did not regret appointing the peer, adding that she would \"not hang around\" in naming her successor. Lady Butler-Sloss said she \"did not sufficiently consider\" whether her family links would cause difficulties in the inquiry. Downing Street said it would \"take a few days\" to appoint a new chairman and appeared to indicate that whoever was chosen would not be so closely linked to the establishment. Mrs May told MPs that she believed Lady Butler-Sloss was the \"right person for the job\" despite what she suggested was a lot of \"rumour and innuendo\" about her appointment. \"I do not regret the decision I made. I continue to believe that Elizabeth Butler-Sloss would have done an excellent job as chair of this inquiry,\" she told the Home Affairs select committee. Asked about her successor, Mrs May said she still favoured appointing a single individual to head the over-arching inquiry rather than a panel of experts urged by Labour and some abuse victims. She said she hoped to name a new candidate \"within a reasonable amount of time\" but said whoever was approached would need to \"think carefully\" about the nature of the role. Keith Vaz, chairman of the committee, which is also investigating historical child sex abuse, said the handling of the issue had been \"somewhat shambolic\" and raised issues about Mrs May's judgement. In a statement, Lady Butler-Sloss said she had been \"honoured\" to be asked to chair the inquiry and had hoped to \"make a useful contribution\". But, she added: \"It has become apparent over the last few days, however, that there is a widespread perception, particularly among victim and survivor groups, that I am not the right person to chair the inquiry. \"It has also become clear to me that I did not sufficiently consider whether my background and the fact my brother had been attorney general would cause difficulties. \"This is a victim-orientated inquiry and those who wish to be heard must have confidence that the members of the panel will pay proper regard to their concerns and give appropriate advice to government. \"Having listened to the concerns of victim and survivor groups and the criticisms of MPs and the media, I have come to the conclusion that I should not chair this inquiry and have so informed the Home Secretary.\" The inquiry was set up to examine how state institutions handled their duty of care to protect children from paedophiles. What next? By BBC political correspondent Iain Watson Most public bodies at least claim they appoint people because of what they know, not who they know. But it was Lady Butler-Sloss's family and political connections - not her experience and knowledge - which led to her resignation. There will be no rush to appoint her successor - it could take several days.

Deradicalisation classes will be made mandatory for others deemed a threat. But Muslim leaders warned the strategy \"continues down a flawed path\" and risks \"alienating\" Muslims in the UK. Also among the measures within the counter-extremism strategy are: Prime Minister David Cameron said the plan would work because it was \"comprehensive\" . \"It's no good leaving this simply to the police or the intelligence services. It's no good simply talking about violent extremism. We need to confront all extremism,\" he said. He said its effectiveness would be measured by whether people were being turned away from extremism, stopped from travelling to fight for IS, and by having \"more cohesive and integrated communities\". Home Secretary Theresa May said non-violent extremism could not go \"uncontested\" as it led to the erosion of women's rights, the spread of intolerance and bigotry and the separation of some communities \"from the mainstream\". She said that applied to neo-Nazi extremism just as much as Islamist doctrine. The Muslim Council of Britain has released a highly-critical statement in response to the plans. Secretary general Dr Shuja Shafi said the strategy would \"reinforce perceptions that all aspects of Muslim life must undergo a 'compliance' test to prove our loyalty to this country\". \"These measures could be seen more as a means to address the anxieties a minority of people may have against Muslims and their religious life, rather than the scourge of terrorism itself,\" he said. Dr Shafi also said he detected \"McCarthyist undertones\" in the plans to create blacklists and exclude and ban people those deemed to be extremists. Mr Mohammed Shafiq, chief executive of the Ramadhan Foundation, said the announcement was a \"missed opportunity to really engage the Muslim community\". But Fiyaz Mughal, director of the interfaith Faith Matters organisation, said there was much in the plans that could \"help in the battle against those who promote extremism\". Robin Brant, BBC political correspondent At the heart of this considerable strategy on counter extremism are two significant challenges for the prime minister: the internet and the law. Getting inciteful content off the web and getting \"counter narrative\" content up there is key to harnessing the full potential of a medium that IS has already mastered. There has been much focus on the mosques but bedroom radicalisation is something the prime minister and MI5 worry intensely about. The process of trying to persuade Facebook, Twitter and other social media giants to help is ongoing. On the second point, the plans to introduce new powers to restrict what extremists can do and where they can go are still in their legal infancy. The government concedes they will need to be properly targeted. It is still consulting with lawyers and community groups to try to get the balance right.

Manager Alan Archibald expects to lose Bannigan in the summer. \"We were aware of him being out of contract in at the end of the season and Dundee United hadn't made a move on it,\" he said of Erskine. \"We have went through the right channels and have that in place and it's a good one to look forward to for next season.\" It will be Erskine's third spell with United's Scottish Premiership rivals. He started his career at Firhill before moving to Tannadice in 2013, only to be loaned back later that season. But he was a first-team regular with the Tangerines last season. This term, he missed out during September, October and November through injury but returned to action in December. Asked if Erskine could join Thistle during the January transfer window, Archibald told BBC Scotland: \"That's down to Dundee United. \"He's their player and we have to respect that and we've just put that in place for next season.\" Archibald laughed off newspaper headlines suggesting that he had threatened to resign should Bannigan be sold during January. \"It was tongue in cheek what I said in the papers,\" he said. \"But I would be devastated and we'll not let him go. \"It would need to be crazy money to let him go. \"It would not be worth it for us as he is a key player. \"If you let your key player go in January for what would not be a great amount of money would send out all the wrong signals.\" However, asked about reported interest by Aberdeen, Archibald said: \"It is just paper talk. There have been a few linked with him. \"He's a good player and out of contract and we expect that. \"We know he is going to go in the summer - he will get good offers. \"But there is no bitterness. We won't get a fee for him, but we've had four or five years out of him playing at the top of his game.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nA Dundee United player is set to join a Scottish Premiership rival in the summer.  \n\nArticle: \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n ", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "A", "▁D", "und", "ee", "▁United", "▁player", "▁is", "▁set", "▁to", "▁join", "▁a", "▁Scottish", "▁Prem", "iers", "hip", "▁rival", "▁in", "▁the", "▁summer", ".", "▁▁", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁", "<0x0A>", "▁▁", "<0x0A>", "▁▁", "<0x0A>", "▁▁", "<0x0A>", "▁▁", "<0x0A>", "▁▁", "<0x0A>", "▁▁", "<0x0A>", "▁▁", "<0x0A>", "▁▁", "<0x0A>", "▁▁", "<0x0A>", "▁▁", "<0x0A>", "▁▁", "<0x0A>", "▁▁", "<0x0A>", "▁▁", "<0x0A>", "▁▁", "<0x0A>", "▁▁", "<0x0A>", "▁▁", "<0x0A>", "▁▁", "<0x0A>", "▁▁"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.5142288208007812, -0.15823814272880554, 0.0, 0.0, -2.861018856492592e-06, -0.030643684789538383, -0.08491462469100952, -0.4426642954349518, -1.6689286894688848e-06, -0.11846552789211273, -0.032833281904459, -0.3618292510509491, -0.00044967554276809096, 0.0, 0.0, -0.03533067926764488, -0.011790587566792965, -0.010169477201998234, -4.768370445162873e-07, -0.260170578956604, -0.5846946835517883, 0.0, 0.0, -0.17209787666797638, 0.0, -1.0251946150674485e-05, -0.0013868723763152957, -0.2220637947320938, -0.001930517959408462, 0.0, -0.6937434077262878, 0.0, -5.447716102935374e-05, 0.0, -9.536738616588991e-07, 0.0, -2.3841855067985307e-07, 0.0, -1.1920928244535389e-07, 0.0, -1.1920928244535389e-07, 0.0, -1.1920928244535389e-07, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "A": -0.5142288208007812, "▁D": -0.15823814272880554, "und": 0.0, "ee": 0.0, "▁United": -2.861018856492592e-06, "▁player": -0.030643684789538383, "▁is": -0.08491462469100952, "▁set": -0.4426642954349518, "▁to": -1.6689286894688848e-06, "▁join": -0.11846552789211273, "▁a": -0.032833281904459, "▁Scottish": -0.3618292510509491, "▁Prem": -0.00044967554276809096, "iers": 0.0, "hip": 0.0, "▁rival": -0.03533067926764488, "▁in": -0.011790587566792965, "▁the": -0.010169477201998234, "▁summer": -4.768370445162873e-07, ".": -0.260170578956604, "▁▁": 0.0, "Art": -0.17209787666797638, "icle": 0.0, ":": -1.0251946150674485e-05, "▁": -0.0013868723763152957}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

A cause of death was not immediately available. Andrew Lloyd Webber was among those paying tribute, describing Stigwood as a \"great showman\" who \"taught me much\". Spencer Gibb called him \"a creative genius with a very quick and dry wit\" adding that \"Robert was the driving force behind The Bee Gees career\". Stigwood started out as an advertising agency copywriter in his native Australia before moving to the UK at the age of 21 There, he made his name representing English singer John Leyton, securing him a role on the TV show Harpers West One. The deal allowed Leyton to perform a song - Johnny Remember Me - which spent four weeks at number one in 1961. By 1966, after a period of bankruptcy, he became a booking agent for The Who, luring them onto his own Reaction Records label, where they recorded the hit single Substitute. He went on to manage Cream and Eric Clapton, before signing the Bee Gees in 1967 and steering them to international success with an intensive promotional campaign for the single New York Mining Disaster 1941. By the early 1970s, though, the Bee Gees had fallen out of favour, and Clapton was inactive due to drug addiction. Stigwood turned his attention to musicals, producing the movie version of Jesus Christ Superstar and The Who's rock opera Tommy. Having bought the management rights to Evita and Jesus Christ Superstar, Stigwood was instrumental in cracking down on unlicensed performances of the musicals in the US - including school productions - to ensure profits went into pockets of its creators. He also formed RSO Records (short for Robert Stigwood Organization), where he resuscitated the careers of his two biggest acts - sending Clapton to the top of the charts with I Shot The Sheriff, and rebranding the Bee Gees as falsetto-voiced disco lynchpins on Jive Talking. The Australian's midas touch continued in the late 1970s, when he produced Saturday Night Fever, making a global star of television actor John Travolta and selling 40 million copies of the Bee Gees-powered soundtrack. Stigwood followed it with the evergreen teen musical Grease, and was particularly proud of casting fellow Australian Olivia Newton John in the role of Sandy. But he faltered with the 1978 Beatles musical Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band - a fantastical but unfocused movie starring The Bee Gees, Peter Frampton and comedian Frankie Howerd. \"If you like the Beatles and you like movies, do yourself a favour and stay away,\" wrote influential US film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum. Audiences took note, and the film flopped at the box office, although the soundtrack sold well. Stigwood went on to produce the similarly-disappointing sequels Grease 2 and Staying Alive - but found success later in life with the Madonna-starring musical Evita, which won the 1997 Golden Globe for best film. The movie's lyricist, Sir Tim Rice, paid tribute to Stigwood on Twitter, calling him \"extraordinary, innovative [and] generous\". \"[He was] a vital part\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nRobert Stigwood, the Australian impresario who managed the Bee Gees and Cream, has died aged 81.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "Ro", "bert", "▁St", "ig", "wood", ",", "▁the", "▁Australian", "▁im", "pres", "ario", "▁who", "▁managed", "▁the", "▁Be", "e", "▁Ge", "es", "▁and", "▁C", "ream", ",", "▁has", "▁died", "▁aged", "▁", "8", "1", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁The", "▁Australian", "▁im", "pres", "ario", "'", "s", "▁death", "▁was", "▁confirmed", "▁on", "▁Facebook", "▁by", "▁Sp", "encer", "▁Gib", "b", ",", "▁son", "▁of", "▁Be", "e", "▁Ge", "es", "▁star", "▁Robin"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.05074448883533478, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -1.7881377516459906e-06, -0.0027589849196374416, -4.51792984677013e-05, -0.378093957901001, 0.0, 0.0, -0.0023667202331125736, -0.08660809695720673, -0.2663482427597046, -0.02324765920639038, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.17333287000656128, -0.9684872627258301, 0.0, -0.1201600506901741, -0.0003216941258870065, 0.0, -0.05475783348083496, 0.0, -1.1920928244535389e-07, 0.0, -0.07966864854097366, -0.7421669363975525, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -0.0007272697403095663, 0.0, 0.0, -1.4305104514278355e-06, 0.0, 0.0, -0.06817829608917236, -0.1451740711927414, -5.2569914259947836e-05, 0.0, 0.0, -7.510157047363464e-06, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "Ro": -0.05074448883533478, "bert": 0.0, "▁St": 0.0, "ig": 0.0, "wood": 0.0, ",": 0.0, "▁the": -0.2663482427597046, "▁Australian": -0.1451740711927414, "▁im": -5.2569914259947836e-05, "pres": 0.0, "ario": 0.0, "▁who": -0.0023667202331125736, "▁managed": -0.08660809695720673, "▁Be": 0.0, "e": 0.0, "▁Ge": 0.0, "es": 0.0, "▁and": -0.17333287000656128, "▁C": -0.9684872627258301, "ream": 0.0, "▁has": -0.0003216941258870065, "▁died": 0.0, "▁aged": -0.05475783348083496, "▁": 0.0, "8": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "1": 0.0, ".": -0.07966864854097366, "##": -0.0007272697403095663, "#": 0.0, "Art": -1.4305104514278355e-06, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "▁The": -0.06817829608917236, "'": -7.510157047363464e-06, "s": 0.0, "▁death": 0.0, "▁was": 0.0, "▁confirmed": 0.0, "▁on": 0.0, "▁Facebook": 0.0, "▁by": 0.0, "▁Sp": 0.0, "encer": 0.0, "▁Gib": 0.0, "b": 0.0, "▁son": 0.0, "▁of": 0.0, "▁star": 0.0, "▁Robin": 0.0}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

It follows rows over attempts by some councils to reduce the length of the school week to help balance their books. Nobody in the mainstream has seriously argued that a cut in the school week would actually help improve children's attainment. Councils which have looked at the idea would argue they have done so out of financial necessity. Their argument has, essentially, been that a cut in the school week for some is a \"least worst option\". When West Dunbartonshire advanced the idea earlier this year, they argued that the cut would affect things such as assemblies and \"golden time\" - not actual teaching time in the classroom. The savings come, for instance, by reducing the number of hours when the building itself is open. Parents have often reacted angrily to the proposals though. Quite apart from any concern they may have about their children's education suffering, some would face practical problems with childcare. With local government funding tight, the problem comes with the amount of flexibility councils have to find the best ways to balance their books. Education in Scotland is, essentially, a national service which councils are entrusted to deliver. There are many nationally set rules and guidelines. For instance, teachers' pay and conditions are standardised across Scotland and there are already minimum requirements on the number of days when schools have to be opened. Councils get the bulk of their money from the Scottish government and the latest funding deal commits councils to maintaining the number of teachers - even though some had argued that was not necessarily the best use of their resources. Councils are under a legal obligation to balance their books. If one potential option for savings is closed, inevitably, it could lead to greater pressure on another service. Local government organisation Cosla is also angry about the government's announcement, claiming there had been a lack of consultation. Some in local government argue councils need greater financial freedom to be able to properly respond to local needs. They see the current financial settlement as something of a straightjacket because they have little real control over the overall size of their budget. A report in the next few weeks by a commission set up by the Scottish government and Cosla will outline various alternatives to the council tax - the tax which typically raises around 15p of every pound councils spend. In some council chambers, there will be disappointment if the debate is not widened to also look at whether councils should be less dependent on central government for cash and have more options on how to raise money locally.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nThe Scottish government is to change the law to make sure children spend a minimum of 25 hours a week in class.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "The", "▁Scottish", "▁government", "▁is", "▁to", "▁change", "▁the", "▁law", "▁to", "▁make", "▁sure", "▁children", "▁spend", "▁a", "▁minimum", "▁of", "▁", "2", "5", "▁hours", "▁a", "▁week", "▁in", "▁class", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁The", "▁government", "▁is", "▁to", "▁change", "▁the", "▁law", "▁to", "▁make", "▁sure", "▁children", "▁spend", "▁a", "▁minimum", "▁of", "▁", "2", "5", "▁hours", "▁a", "▁week", "▁in", "▁class", ".", "▁It", "▁follows", "▁rows", "▁over", "▁attempts", "▁by"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.007298000156879425, -5.602679812000133e-05, -8.583032467868179e-06, -0.020404083654284477, -0.08178095519542694, -4.815939246327616e-05, 0.0, 0.0, -0.0012718691723421216, -0.0019287331961095333, 0.0, -3.0040289857424796e-05, 0.0, -2.50339189733495e-06, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -9.536738616588991e-07, -0.002140970202162862, -0.18386565148830414, 0.0, -2.3841855067985307e-07, 0.0, 0.0, -1.1920922133867862e-06, 0.0, 0.0, -0.040819551795721054, -1.051952838897705, -0.5280260443687439, -0.008289455436170101, -0.19390124082565308, 0.0, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -0.0012736550997942686, -0.015393847599625587, 0.0, -0.0008499585674144328, -2.0265558760002023e-06, -2.062299427052494e-05, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -2.3841855067985307e-07, 0.0, 0.0, -0.00020382710499688983, -0.012087429873645306, -0.02650827169418335, -5.1616290875244886e-05, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "The": -0.007298000156879425, "▁Scottish": -5.602679812000133e-05, "▁government": -1.051952838897705, "▁is": -0.5280260443687439, "▁to": -0.0012736550997942686, "▁change": -0.19390124082565308, "▁the": 0.0, "▁law": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "▁make": -0.015393847599625587, "▁sure": 0.0, "▁children": -0.0008499585674144328, "▁spend": -2.0265558760002023e-06, "▁a": -2.3841855067985307e-07, "▁minimum": 0.0, "▁of": 0.0, "▁": 0.0, "2": 0.0, "5": 0.0, "▁hours": 0.0, "▁week": 0.0, "▁in": 0.0, "▁class": -0.00020382710499688983, ".": -0.012087429873645306, "##": -2.3841855067985307e-07, "#": 0.0, "Art": -1.1920922133867862e-06, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "▁The": -0.040819551795721054, "▁It": -0.02650827169418335, "▁follows": -5.1616290875244886e-05, "▁rows": 0.0, "▁over": 0.0, "▁attempts": 0.0, "▁by": 0.0}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

He is believed to have been originally known as Ronald Fiddler. Fiddler, 50 and from Manchester, was sent to Guantanamo Bay in 2002. IS has now published a photograph of Fiddler, who was also known as Jamul-Uddin al-Harith before taking the nom-du-guerre Abu-Zakariya al-Britani. He had been seized by US forces in Pakistan in 2001, before being sent to Guantanamo. US interrogators found he provided useful information to them about the Taliban's methods, and he was released after two years. The Daily Mail reported Fiddler received a million pounds in compensation from the government when he came back to the UK. The BBC has seen IS registration papers signed by Fiddler in April 2014 when he crossed into Syria from Turkey. He volunteered to be a fighter, saying his knowledge of Islam was basic. His wife told the Daily Mirror that she and their five children went to Syria try to persuade him to come back, but failed, and they ended up having to flee for their lives from IS territory. Afzal Ashraf, a former counter-terrorism adviser to the United States in Iraq, told the BBC this incident demonstrated that \"some of the people in Guantanamo Bay were up to no good\". \"It also throws into question some of the organisations that were supporting him, that brought him back [from Guantanamo]. \"Some of them were associated a little too closely with this radical ideology, and they use the legal system - freedoms of speech, the importance of the rule of law - in order to subvert some of our systems in the UK and elsewhere.\" BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner says the \"pipeline\" of British and European jihadists who once crossed the Turkish border into Syria, into IS-controlled territory, has now \"pretty much dried up\". He added: \"Guantanamo Bay was incredibly bad in the ideological fight against extremism. It makes it very difficult for America, Britain and other countries whose nationals are there to maintain any kind of moral high ground, because they [detainees] were imprisoned without trial. \"And what do you do about the estimated 400 British jihadists who are still out there? If they don't die on the battlefield, are they going to try and come back? How do you monitor them? Do you believe the people who say 'I've turned my back on all of that'. \"Most people will probably want to do exactly that. Some, though, may have other ideas.\" According to figures published by the UK government last year, about 850 people regarded as a national security concern have gone to become fighters in the Middle East. Of those, just under half have returned to the UK and approximately 15% are dead. A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: \"The UK has advised for some time against all travel to Syria, and against all travel to large parts of Iraq. \"As all UK consular services are suspended in Syria and greatly limited\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nThe BBC has seen IS registration papers signed by Fiddler in April 2014 when he crossed into Syria from Turkey.

In a statement, a university spokesman said: \"After consultation with the senate of the University of Glasgow the affected examination has been declared void and a new clinical examination will be set for all final year students. \"This decision has been made in an abundance of caution to ensure that the skills of our students are rigorously and fairly tested before they graduate in medicine.\" The new exam will take place at the beginning of May, with any resits resulting from that paper to be taken later the same month.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.0006106419023126364, -0.08899016678333282, -1.0490362910786644e-05, -9.536738616588991e-07, -3.576278118089249e-07, -1.1920928244535389e-07, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

However, the council wants the final say on whether pupils can return to all 17 schools closed over safety fears. The council is to have a \"clearer picture\" from surveys on Friday. Why are Edinburgh schools closed? Seventeen schools built or modernised just over a decade ago under the controversial Public Private Partnership arrangement scheme were shut earlier this month over safety concerns. The council had entered into a deal to build the schools with the specially-formed private company, the Edinburgh Schools Partnership, and construction work was carried out by Miller Construction. Under the deal, the profit-making company built the schools, runs the buildings and maintains them. The council is, in effect, a tenant. Children at all 17 schools are now back in classrooms but finding alternative accommodation has been a major logistical operation and some youngsters face lengthy journeys to temporary sites. Some form of investigation or inquiry into the debacle is expected to be launched after the Scottish election. 17 Schools closed over safety fears 7,600 Primary and secondary pupils affected by the closures 61 Alternative schools are being used 655 Teachers relocated 70 Bus services laid on to transport pupils A City of Edinburgh Council spokesman said: \"The council will appoint independent experts to give us the necessary reassurance that work carried out by the Edinburgh Schools Partnership and its contractors is of the required standard to ensure the safety of children.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nEdinburgh schools closed over safety fears.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "Ed", "inburgh", "▁schools", "▁closed", "▁over", "▁safety", "▁fear", "s", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁The", "▁", "1", "9", "-", "year", "-", "old", "▁has", "▁been", "▁released", "▁on", "▁b", "ail", "▁after", "▁being", "▁arrested", "▁in", "▁connection", "▁with", "▁the", "▁attack", "▁on", "▁the", "▁", "2", "4", "-", "year", "-", "old", "▁man", "▁in", "▁the", "▁city", "▁centre", ".", "▁The", "▁man", "▁was", "▁taken", "▁to", "▁the", "▁Royal", "▁Inf", "irm"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -1.0385475158691406, 0.0, -0.17037157714366913, -0.06368593871593475, -0.0247921384871006, -5.960462772236497e-07, -0.00015841660206206143, 0.0, -0.018556680530309677, -0.00339788431301713, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.053710196167230606, -0.19209258258342743, -0.3772997260093689, -0.43862929940223694, -0.6903051733970642, -8.583032467868179e-06, -3.576278118089249e-07, 0.0, -0.21132192015647888, -0.0005584587925113738, -0.2606029510498047, -0.3624572455883026, -0.0002506657037883997, 0.0, -0.5762131810188293, -0.03853349760174751, -0.3981474041938782, -0.2679542601108551, -0.0009631047723814845, -0.00024029705673456192, -0.01307061966508627, -0.46402430534362793, -0.04271039366722107, -0.0742412880063057, -0.13813188672065735, -0.1912812441587448, -0.8512455224990845, -2.3841574147809297e-05, 0.0, -7.152555099310121e-07, 0.0, -1.0662795305252075, -0.2737717032432556, -0.01564561389386654, -0.4336528480052948, -0.03512030839920044, -0.7037399411201477, -0.5804850459098816, -0.3213844895362854, -0.024599311873316765, -0.4012391269207001, -3.576278118089249e-07, -0.4005521237850189, -0.44390320777893066, -0.0004567056894302368, 0.0], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "Ed": -1.0385475158691406, "inburgh": 0.0, "▁schools": -0.17037157714366913, "▁closed": -0.06368593871593475, "▁over": -0.0247921384871006, "▁safety": -5.960462772236497e-07, "▁fear": -0.00015841660206206143, "s": 0.0, ".": -0.7037399411201477, "##": 0.0, "#": 0.0, "Art": 0.0, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "▁The": -0.5804850459098816, "▁": -0.13813188672065735, "1": -0.3772997260093689, "9": -0.43862929940223694, "-": -7.152555099310121e-07, "year": 0.0, "old": 0.0, "▁has": -0.21132192015647888, "▁been": -0.0005584587925113738, "▁released": -0.2606029510498047, "▁on": -0.04271039366722107, "▁b": -0.0002506657037883997, "ail": 0.0, "▁after": -0.5762131810188293, "▁being": -0.03853349760174751, "▁arrested": -0.3981474041938782, "▁in": -0.2737717032432556, "▁connection": -0.0009631047723814845, "▁with": -0.00024029705673456192, "▁the": -0.4005521237850189, "▁attack": -0.46402430534362793, "2": -0.1912812441587448, "4": -0.8512455224990845, "▁man": -0.3213844895362854, "▁city": -0.4336528480052948, "▁centre": -0.03512030839920044, "▁was": -0.024599311873316765, "▁taken": -0.4012391269207001, "▁to": -3.576278118089249e-07, "▁Royal": -0.44390320777893066, "▁Inf": -0.0004567056894302368, "irm": 0.0}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

Sasikala Natarajan, a close aide to the late chief minister J Jayalalitha, was appointed to the post on Sunday. The decision has fuelled anger as Ms Natarajan has never held public office. She was made general secretary of the AIADMK party after Jayalalitha's death in December. The recording of Ms Ashhraf's live video has been viewed 45,000 times and shared almost 1,000 times since it was uploaded to Facebook 18 hours ago. Tamil Nadu to get second woman leader The Indian rapper who took on a multinational \"The youth are getting increasingly agitated, and this appointment of a woman who has never stood for election being made chief minister was the straw that broke the camel's back,\" Ms Ashraf told the BBC. \"It has made us lose faith in democracy.\" The AIADMK had earlier explained its choice of chief minister. \"Like Amma [mother], we wanted a strong woman leader to serve the people,\" party spokesperson CR Saraswathi told the AFP news agency, referring to Jayalalitha by her popular nickname. Ms Ashraf says she was performing at a venue two streets away from Ms Natarajan's residence in Chennai (Madras) when her band decided to change the lyrics to one of her songs. She and others marched towards the house and transmitted it live on Facebook.

The gang, from Essex and east London, will be sentenced later. Live: For more on this and other Essex stories All four admitted handling about 750 puppies between July 2013 and October 2014. The court heard the animals were sold for an average of £450 each and the RSPCA estimates the fraud was worth more than £300,000. The court was shown video footage shot by the RSPCA of dozens of cockerpoo (a cocker spaniel and poodle crossbreed) puppies kept in cages inside dark sheds near South Ockendon. The dogs - some barely two weeks old - had soiled newspapers for bedding, no toys and some had no heating. Teresa Wade, of Ship Lane, Aveley, South Ockendon, admitted advertising them over the internet as being home-reared, and that they were shown to prospective buyers at houses belonging to the other defendants, before being sold for up to £750 each in cash. But some of the animals were so sick they died shortly after arriving at their new homes, or cost their new owners thousands of pounds in vet bills. Wade will be sentenced later along with Victoria Montgomery, of Melford Avenue, Dagenham, and Hammond and Roxanne Montgomery, both of Grafton Raod, Dagenham.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nFour people have been convicted of fraudulently selling puppies as home-reared. \n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  ", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "F", "our", "▁people", "▁have", "▁been", "▁conv", "icted", "▁of", "▁fra", "ud", "ul", "ently", "▁s", "elling", "▁pu", "pp", "ies", "▁as", "▁home", "-", "re", "ared", ".", "▁", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "▁▁", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "▁▁", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "▁▁", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "▁▁", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "▁▁", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "▁▁", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "▁▁", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "▁▁", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "▁▁", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "▁▁", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "▁▁", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "▁▁", "<0x0A>"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.36318302154541016, -0.006717006675899029, -1.728519782773219e-05, -0.032081667333841324, -0.05547455698251724, -0.026914970949292183, 0.0, -0.0007969540893100202, -0.7420397996902466, 0.0, -0.216545969247818, -1.6689286894688848e-06, -0.0013410394312813878, 0.0, -0.02660961262881756, 0.0, 0.0, -0.277523934841156, -0.0013061572099104524, -0.0020354522857815027, -0.015384926460683346, 0.0, -0.9265580177307129, -0.4080101549625397, -1.0609570381348021e-05, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -0.31104081869125366, -0.0015887507470324636, -0.02340989001095295, 0.0, -4.410734163684538e-06, -0.22675621509552002, 0.0, -5.722029527532868e-06, -0.00710342638194561, 0.0, -0.00015841660206206143, -0.0067710005678236485, 0.0, -6.890059739816934e-05, -0.01020511332899332, 0.0, -1.6689286894688848e-06, -0.006762475706636906, 0.0, 0.0, -0.00676188338547945, 0.0, 0.0, -0.0029372903518378735, 0.0, 0.0, -0.0008442413527518511, 0.0, 0.0, -0.0005566716426983476, 0.0, 0.0, -0.0003682888636831194, 0.0, 0.0, -0.00016091958968900144, 0.0], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "F": -0.36318302154541016, "our": -0.006717006675899029, "▁people": -1.728519782773219e-05, "▁have": -0.032081667333841324, "▁been": -0.05547455698251724, "▁conv": -0.026914970949292183, "icted": 0.0, "▁of": -0.0007969540893100202, "▁fra": -0.7420397996902466, "ud": 0.0, "ul": -0.216545969247818, "ently": -1.6689286894688848e-06, "▁s": -0.0013410394312813878, "elling": 0.0, "▁pu": -0.02660961262881756, "pp": 0.0, "ies": 0.0, "▁as": -0.277523934841156, "▁home": -0.0013061572099104524, "-": -0.0020354522857815027, "re": -0.015384926460683346, "ared": 0.0, ".": -0.9265580177307129, "▁": -0.4080101549625397, "▁▁": -0.00016091958968900144}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

It was sent to UKIP's national executive committee (NEC) before a row over racial slurs about a Labour MP, for which Ms Brown apologised. But UKIP chairman Paul Oakden said the letter did not follow proper process. A UKIP assembly group spokesman said the letter was written by a group with a \"long-standing grudge\" against the AM. The ruling NEC body discussed the issue at a meeting on Friday, where they also decided to allow a controversial anti-Islam campaigner to run for the UKIP leadership. Mr Oakden said: \"A member of the NEC had contacted the person that is putting this forward and said to them they need to follow the proper process of completing the necessary forms and submitting them to the NEC. \"Members simply emailing the NEC saying we want you to do this is not the correct disciplinary process for the party, by any stretch of the imagination. \"A member of the NEC has gone back and given advice on what they need to do.\" Shaun Owen, secretary of UKIP's Delyn branch, wrote to the NEC saying: \"For some time we have been appalled by the abrasive and discourteous manner of Ms Brown towards UKIP locally. \"Her lack of effort in pursuing the aims of the party both locally and nationally is of concern to members across the region.\" Mr Owen added he believed members would stop supporting UKIP if Ms Brown remained in the role. However, a spokesman for the party's assembly group dismissed the letter as written by a \"tiny and insignificant group\". In February, Ms Brown denied an allegation she had smoked recreational drugs in a hotel room. Later that month, she said she had acted \"with propriety\" after it was revealed she had discussed how an advert for a job in her assembly office could be changed to help her brother get an interview for the post. Meanwhile, UKIP's NEC confirmed that 11 hopefuls in the contest to succeed Paul Nuttall as leader will be able to run as candidates. The list includes Anne Marie Waters, the founder of the Sharia Watch pressure group, who has described Islam as evil. UKIP AM David Rowlands had said Ms Waters is probably \"too extreme\" to be allowed to stand but she claimed the party was trying to \"ostracise\" her. Other candidates who have also cleared the NEC's vetting process and are going forward to a vote of the membership include Welsh activist John Rees-Evans, London Assembly member Peter Whittle and Scottish MEP David Coburn.

But the latest Dembele - no relation - came on for the final nine minutes of Celtic Under-20s' win against Hearts. He replaced Jack Aitchison, 16, who became Celtic's youngest-ever player in the final game of last season. Aitchison scored with his first touch after coming on as a substitute aged 16 years and 71 days in their 7-0 rout of Motherwell in May. But Ivorian Dembele could challenge that record after appearing for the club's reserve team, which is seven years above his age group. Dembele went viral with a series of tricks playing for Celtic's U13s at the St Kevin's Boys Academy Cup tournament in Dublin this summer. Celtic's website said Dembele \"didn't look out of place\" after being given his chance on Monday at Greenock Morton's Cappielow ground, with six of their usual squad away on Scotland U19s duty. The 15-year-old Kieran McGrath also played. Celtic's head of youth, Chris McCart, added: \"We were all delighted to see Karamoko make his debut for the development squad against Hearts in what proved to be an entertaining game. \"The fact that he was playing against other players seven years his senior gives an indication of the quality this young boy possesses and it was also fitting that he came on for Jack Aitchison, the club's youngest-ever goalscorer. \"What we need to remember, though, is that Karamoko is just 13 years old. He was given a chance to play last night on merit, as was Kieran, but it is very important that we continue their development at a measured pace. \"Karamoko is still a young boy and has a lot of growing to do, both physically and mentally. \"The coaches at our under-13 and 14 levels have been fantastic in nurturing his potential, but it is crucial that we do not push him too far, too soon. \"He has a lot of hard work ahead of him to make it to the top and we won't rush that, but we also know Karamoko, and the other talented young players we have here, is at the perfect place to continue his progress and we look forward to seeing what the future holds for this young player.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nA 15-year-old Celtic player has made his senior team debut .\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "A", "▁", "1", "5", "-", "year", "-", "old", "▁C", "elt", "ic", "▁player", "▁has", "▁made", "▁his", "▁senior", "▁team", "▁debut", "▁.", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁The", "▁", "2", "0", "1", "8", "▁Winter", "▁Olympics", "▁are", "▁set", "▁to", "▁begin", "▁on", "▁Friday", ",", "▁February", "▁", "9", ",", "▁", "2", "0", "1", "8", ",", "▁in", "▁P", "ye", "ong", "ch", "ang", ",", "▁South", "▁Korea", "▁.", "▁The"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.0014132998185232282, -0.0015864893794059753, 0.0, -0.01017006766051054, -0.0006573423161171377, 0.0, -1.0728830375228426e-06, 0.0, -0.5037696361541748, 0.0, 0.0, -0.0017971331253647804, -0.11429604887962341, -0.024041669443249702, -8.189342770492658e-05, -0.7646374106407166, -0.01538868248462677, -5.602820692729438e-06, -0.9333683848381042, -0.001279965159483254, 0.0, -0.004512484651058912, 0.0, 0.0, -9.536738616588991e-07, 0.0, 0.0, -0.12222015857696533, -0.10004577785730362, -0.5128751993179321, -0.014484732411801815, -0.0004161922261118889, -0.38953620195388794, -0.8220325112342834, -6.937739817658439e-05, -0.39220133423805237, -0.4220951497554779, -2.50339189733495e-06, -0.08964431285858154, -0.5093698501586914, -0.13096174597740173, -0.08077555894851685, -0.1933424323797226, 0.0, -7.056941103655845e-05, -0.024161530658602715, -0.7997753024101257, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.03954054042696953, -0.020358646288514137, -0.004477594513446093, 0.0, 0.0, -0.0012718691723421216, 0.0, -0.0008386432309634984, 0.0, 0.0, -0.05690579116344452, -0.005852112080901861], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "A": -0.0014132998185232282, "▁": -0.7997753024101257, "1": 0.0, "5": -0.01017006766051054, "-": -1.0728830375228426e-06, "year": 0.0, "old": 0.0, "▁C": -0.5037696361541748, "elt": 0.0, "ic": 0.0, "▁player": -0.0017971331253647804, "▁has": -0.11429604887962341, "▁made": -0.024041669443249702, "▁his": -8.189342770492658e-05, "▁senior": -0.7646374106407166, "▁team": -0.01538868248462677, "▁debut": -5.602820692729438e-06, "▁.": -0.05690579116344452, "##": -0.004512484651058912, "#": 0.0, "Art": -9.536738616588991e-07, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "▁The": -0.005852112080901861, "2": 0.0, "0": 0.0, "8": 0.0, "▁Winter": -0.8220325112342834, "▁Olympics": -6.937739817658439e-05, "▁are": -0.39220133423805237, "▁set": -0.4220951497554779, "▁to": -2.50339189733495e-06, "▁begin": -0.08964431285858154, "▁on": -0.5093698501586914, "▁Friday": -0.13096174597740173, ",": -0.0008386432309634984, "▁February": -0.1933424323797226, "9": -7.056941103655845e-05, "▁in": -0.020358646288514137, "▁P": -0.004477594513446093, "ye": 0.0, "ong": 0.0, "ch": -0.0012718691723421216, "ang": 0.0, "▁South": 0.0, "▁Korea": 0.0}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

Some of the promises are not yet formalised and environmentalists say the measures proposed are not nearly urgent enough. But UN officials praised the statement. Meeting in New York, they said it was part of a clear international shift against ocean pollution. Eric Solheim, the UN's environment director, told BBC News: \"There are quite encouraging signs, with nations taking the ocean much more seriously. Of course, there is a very long way to go because the problems are huge.\" It is estimated that 5-13 million tonnes of plastics flow into the world's oceans annually. Much of it is ingested by birds and fish â€“ and fragments of plastic have even been found in organisms at the bottom of the ocean. A recent paper said much of the marine plastic often originates far from the sea â€“ especially in countries which have developed consumer economies faster than their ability to manage waste. The Helmholtz Centre in Leipzig, Germany, estimated that 75% of land-borne marine pollution comes from just 10 rivers, predominantly in Asia. Reducing the plastic loads in these rivers by 50% would reduce global plastic inputs by 37%, it said. Tom Dillon from the Pew Charitable Trusts, which campaign on oceans, urged China to move quickly. He told BBC News: \"For thousands of years the Maritime Silk Road was a pathway for export of Chinese culture and influence. Will the ocean be a vehicle for export of Chinese pollution, or a new culture of conservation and sustainability?\" A report to the UN conference from the Thailand government says most marine plastic debris is land-based, caused by inefficient waste management and poor handling of plastic wastes. In Thailand, the total amount of garbage finding its way into the sea was estimated at 2.83 million tonnes in 2016 - of which 12% was plastic. The Thai government says the nation has established a 20-year strategy to tackle the problem, including developing financial incentives for keeping plastic out of the sea and encouraging eco-packaging design and eco-friendly substitutes for plastics. In Indonesia, the government is starting a mass education programme for schoolchildren, and in the Philippines new laws are being developed. Part of the challenge is finding substitutes for plastics. An international prize for smarter materials and design for packaging was launched recently by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.

But signs at cashier desks appear to demand full price, the suit contends. The museum says its \"recommended\" policy has been place for 40 years and it makes no effort to deceive visitors. The lawsuit, filed in New York City on behalf of former patrons, contends that the world famous museum, which receives six million visitors a year, uses misleading marketing and cashier training to deceive unwary visitors. Lawyers say the signs in the lobby listing the price of admission with the word \"recommended\" below in smaller type violate a 1893 law mandating the public be admitted free of charge at least five days and two evenings per week in exchange for monetary grants and rent-free use of city-owned land. The suit, which lawyers hope will eventually represent a broad class of people who have visited the museum in recent years, seeks a change in the admissions policy and reimbursement for those who they say were misled. Confusion over whether visitors were required to pay the full $25 is \"an issue with tourists travelling to the US from a foreign country\", Michael Hiller, a lawyer for those who brought the suit, told the BBC. \"They are violating the statute, plainly and simply,\" Mr Hiller said, referring to the 1893 law. \"The museum was designed to make art accessible to the public.\" A former employee of the Met is expected to testify, Mr Hiller said. The witness, who trained cashiers from 2007-2011, alleges that signage was changed from \"suggested\" to \"recommended\" because administrators believed it would encourage people to pay more, Mr Hiller said. Harold Holzer, a spokesman for the museum, said the 1893 law had been superseded. New York City agreed to the museum's request in 1970 to charge an admission fee - so long as the amount was left up to individuals and the signage reflected that. About 40% of visitors pay full price, Mr Holzer said. He said gate proceeds allowed the Met to offer free admission to special exhibitions. About 11% of the museum's operating expenses were covered by admissions last year. As a non-profit organisation, the museum pays no income taxes. It is one of the wealthiest museums in the world, with a $2bn investment portfolio. Mr Holzer estimated the museum would receive 15-20% of its operating budget from the fees this year, with 11% coming from city grants. The Met believes its policy \"guarantees access for people regardless of their ability to pay\", Mr Holzer said. He noted other New York City museums charge steep admission fees. Entrance fees for prominent New York City art museums such as the Whitney, the Museum of Modern Art and the Guggenheim range from $18 to $25. Mr Hiller demands the museum stop charging entirely for admission and remove the cashier desks. \"You have got to eliminate any effort to charge people,\" he said.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nA lawsuit accuses the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York of misleading visitors about the price of admission.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "A", "▁law", "suit", "▁acc", "uses", "▁the", "▁Metropolitan", "▁Museum", "▁of", "▁Art", "▁in", "▁New", "▁York", "▁of", "▁mis", "leading", "▁visitors", "▁about", "▁the", "▁price", "▁of", "▁ad", "mission", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁The", "▁", "2", "0", "1", "7", "▁Nobel", "▁Prize", "▁in", "▁Physics", "▁was", "▁awarded", "▁to", "▁three", "▁scient", "ists", "▁who", "▁helped", "▁explain", "▁the", "▁myster", "ies", "▁of", "▁the", "▁universe", "'", "s", "▁expansion", ".", "▁The", "▁Royal"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.002013562014326453, -0.007109581492841244, 0.0, -0.7937465906143188, -0.00010442188795423135, -0.17326852679252625, -5.125986263010418e-06, 0.0, -1.0728830375228426e-06, 0.0, -0.36091604828834534, -1.6689286894688848e-06, 0.0, -0.01017136499285698, -0.3047042191028595, -4.887569048150908e-06, -0.10014327615499496, -0.4532121419906616, -0.27544987201690674, -0.17714686691761017, -0.010198977775871754, -6.258291978156194e-05, 0.0, -0.5457617044448853, -0.7647107839584351, -2.3841855067985307e-07, -0.00016139635408762842, 0.0, 0.0, -4.768370445162873e-07, 0.0, 0.0, -0.06284522265195847, -0.6589073538780212, -0.3810959458351135, -0.007041164208203554, -0.010263049043715, -0.29572224617004395, -0.06479211896657944, -4.6967357775429264e-05, -0.0005529781919904053, -0.5727293491363525, -0.17325158417224884, -1.4543427823809907e-05, -0.08332005888223648, -0.008332251571118832, -0.09940218180418015, 0.0, -0.26080870628356934, -0.3696478307247162, -0.7474717497825623, -0.37624993920326233, -3.504691630951129e-05, -0.023245446383953094, -1.0728830375228426e-06, -0.050562042742967606, -0.0004742213059216738, -0.5398485064506531, 0.0, -0.041539471596479416, -0.13238516449928284, -0.18117763102054596, -0.534813642501831], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "A": -0.002013562014326453, "▁law": -0.007109581492841244, "suit": 0.0, "▁acc": -0.7937465906143188, "uses": -0.00010442188795423135, "▁the": -0.050562042742967606, "▁Metropolitan": -5.125986263010418e-06, "▁Museum": 0.0, "▁of": -1.0728830375228426e-06, "▁Art": 0.0, "▁in": -0.0005529781919904053, "▁New": -1.6689286894688848e-06, "▁York": 0.0, "▁mis": -0.3047042191028595, "leading": -4.887569048150908e-06, "▁visitors": -0.10014327615499496, "▁about": -0.4532121419906616, "▁price": -0.17714686691761017, "▁ad": -6.258291978156194e-05, "mission": 0.0, ".": -0.13238516449928284, "##": -0.00016139635408762842, "#": 0.0, "Art": -4.768370445162873e-07, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "▁The": -0.18117763102054596, "▁": -0.6589073538780212, "2": -0.3810959458351135, "0": -0.007041164208203554, "1": -0.010263049043715, "7": -0.29572224617004395, "▁Nobel": -0.06479211896657944, "▁Prize": -4.6967357775429264e-05, "▁Physics": -0.5727293491363525, "▁was": -0.17325158417224884, "▁awarded": -1.4543427823809907e-05, "▁to": -0.08332005888223648, "▁three": -0.008332251571118832, "▁scient": -0.09940218180418015, "ists": 0.0, "▁who": -0.26080870628356934, "▁helped": -0.3696478307247162, "▁explain": -0.7474717497825623, "▁myster": -3.504691630951129e-05, "ies": -0.023245446383953094, "▁universe": -0.0004742213059216738, "'": -0.5398485064506531, "s": 0.0, "▁expansion": -0.041539471596479416, "▁Royal": -0.534813642501831}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

Adam Scorer was speaking after it emerged that the Grenfell Tower fire started in a Hotpoint fridge-freezer. Some 79 people are feared dead. He told 5 Live's Wake Up to Money that while councils were responsible for trading standards, there was no central system to relay information about products to the public. \"Consumers should be confident that most products are safe, but we do know that the regime is as strong as its weakest link,\" Mr Scorer said. \"We don't have a central organisation of technical resources, we don't have core funding where we can be sure of who is going to be around to do this testing, and we don't have the right level of strategic communication to make sure that risks are placed on the system, flags are alerted and people are able to go in and do the right level of investigation of all the products that are concerned.\" Former Business Secretary Sir Vince Cable told the programme that trading standards were a problem area because they were not a statutory obligation of local government. \"There are some things local government is required to do - trading standards not so,\" he said. \"So when local councils are under financial pressure it is something they can cut back on.\" Although the Department of Business provides Â£15m annually for national trading standards activities, the vast majority of services are funded by local authorities. The departments were once known as Weights and Measures. Sir Vince suggested imposing an obligation on local authorities to strengthen trading standards, adding: \"Or you could give them some financial support, which I think is what we should be probably doing, to have some ring-fenced money that supports what is currently a declining service.\" He was Business Secretary when former BBC presenter Lynn Faulds-Wood was commissioned to investigate product safety. She claims the government ignored her report. \"I think Lynn Faulds-Wood's concern is she made recommendations that were very modest and did not entail public cost, [but] even they have not been acted on and that was where she is enormously frustrated.\" Sir Vince added: \"There is a tendency at the moment to look at whether the costs are to business rather than whether the costs are to society as a whole.\" A Department for Business spokesperson said: \"Funding and prioritisation for trading standards are decisions for local authorities - accountable to local communities and the people they serve. Government recognises that consumer protection goes beyond local authority boundaries, which is why we provide Â£15m per year for coordinated Trading Standards activity in the UK.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nA government watchdog says local authorities are forced to make a \"wicked\" choice between what services they provide because of austerity .  \n\n[INST] Write a title for this article: MH17: Malaysia Airlines plane shot down over Ukraine, 295 dead (Document", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "A", "▁government", "▁watch", "dog", "▁says", "▁local", "▁authorities", "▁are", "▁forced", "▁to", "▁make", "▁a", "▁\"", "wick", "ed", "\"", "▁choice", "▁between", "▁what", "▁services", "▁they", "▁provide", "▁because", "▁of", "▁a", "uster", "ity", "▁.", "▁▁", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "[", "INST", "]", "▁Write", "▁a", "▁title", "▁for", "▁this", "▁article", ":", "▁M", "H", "1", "7", ":", "▁Malays", "ia", "▁Airlines", "▁plane", "▁shot", "▁down", "▁over", "▁Ukraine", ",", "▁", "2", "9", "5", "▁dead", "▁(", "Document", "["], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.17663617432117462, -0.30729642510414124, -0.6557558178901672, 0.0, -0.5493141412734985, -0.12156197428703308, -0.015546910464763641, -0.023399990051984787, -0.5326109528541565, -3.576278118089249e-07, -0.00031704644788987935, -0.002933486830443144, -0.0005987281911075115, -2.3841855067985307e-07, 0.0, -1.9788545614574105e-05, 0.0, -0.00011359999916749075, -4.732496745418757e-05, -1.311301275563892e-06, -0.00036459474358707666, -5.722029527532868e-06, -1.3947389561508317e-05, 0.0, -6.794906312279636e-06, 0.0, 0.0, -0.2536170184612274, -0.6935129761695862, 0.0, 0.0, -0.07988889515399933, 0.0, 0.0, -0.5778785347938538, -0.05271483585238457, -0.0005955114611424506, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -8.583032467868179e-06, -4.768370445162873e-07, 0.0, -0.7644793391227722, -0.6444836854934692, -0.10039076209068298, 0.0, -0.4409497082233429, -0.6482778191566467, -0.015384926460683346, -0.4433906674385071, -0.13368600606918335, -0.028561895713210106, -7.152555099310121e-07, -0.006751700770109892, -0.015385630540549755, -0.01059903483837843, -0.0026209547650069, -0.004205194301903248, -0.0019290901254862547, -0.5065808296203613, -0.005532429553568363, -0.014066362753510475, -0.3529685139656067, 0.0], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "A": -0.17663617432117462, "▁government": -0.30729642510414124, "▁watch": -0.6557558178901672, "dog": 0.0, "▁says": -0.5493141412734985, "▁local": -0.12156197428703308, "▁authorities": -0.015546910464763641, "▁are": -0.023399990051984787, "▁forced": -0.5326109528541565, "▁to": -3.576278118089249e-07, "▁make": -0.00031704644788987935, "▁a": -0.05271483585238457, "▁\"": -0.0005987281911075115, "wick": -2.3841855067985307e-07, "ed": 0.0, "\"": -1.9788545614574105e-05, "▁choice": 0.0, "▁between": -0.00011359999916749075, "▁what": -4.732496745418757e-05, "▁services": -1.311301275563892e-06, "▁they": -0.00036459474358707666, "▁provide": -5.722029527532868e-06, "▁because": -1.3947389561508317e-05, "▁of": 0.0, "uster": 0.0, "ity": 0.0, "▁.": -0.2536170184612274, "▁▁": -0.6935129761695862, "[": 0.0, "INST": 0.0, "]": 0.0, "▁Write": -0.5778785347938538, "▁title": -0.0005955114611424506, "▁for": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "▁this": -8.583032467868179e-06, "▁article": -4.768370445162873e-07, ":": -0.4409497082233429, "▁M": -0.7644793391227722, "H": -0.6444836854934692, "1": -0.10039076209068298, "7": 0.0, "▁Malays": -0.6482778191566467, "ia": -0.015384926460683346, "▁Airlines": -0.4433906674385071, "▁plane": -0.13368600606918335, "▁shot": -0.028561895713210106, "▁down": -7.152555099310121e-07, "▁over": -0.006751700770109892, "▁Ukraine": -0.015385630540549755, ",": -0.01059903483837843, "▁": -0.0026209547650069, "2": -0.004205194301903248, "9": -0.0019290901254862547, "5": -0.5065808296203613, "▁dead": -0.005532429553568363, "▁(": -0.014066362753510475, "Document": -0.3529685139656067}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

Mr Ferguson said: \"The rollout has done what I hoped it would do, with most opposition fading once a scheme goes live, and the majority of residents and traders being pleasantly surprised. \"The feedback we're getting is that parking becomes much easier in the residents' parking zones.\" He added that he would ask for the views of local councillors and neighbourhood partnerships before \"reconsidering an extension to the scheme\".\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.007451478857547045, -0.5663192272186279, -4.672895011026412e-05, -2.7418097943154862e-06, -7.152555099310121e-07, -1.1920928244535389e-07, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

They want to push up the price of crude oil, which is less than half what it was in June 2014 In previous episodes of falling prices, Opec has been much quicker to respond, often cutting output. The agenda for the meeting in Doha, the capital of Qatar, is a freeze in production. No cuts in other words, just a commitment to no more increases. But even that possibility has given some support in recent weeks to the price of oil. The low it reached earlier this year was about $27 a barrel for Brent crude oil, one of the leading international market prices. This week it has been very close to $45. That is to a large extent due to traders considering the possibility that some oil producers are close to taking some sort of action to push prices higher. It's worth emphasising that even at current levels the price of oil is far below where it was as recently as June 2014 - when it reached $115. The fall has hurt many oil producing countries. Earlier this week, the International Monetary Fund said it had damaged financial stability and the government finances in many of them. The meeting is not formally an Opec event, though all or very nearly all the group's members will be represented. There will also be some non-members, notably Russia. The decision to hold this meeting, with a rather unusual group of attendees, reflects the oil exporters' persistent concerns about the level of prices and a feeling that any action needs to involve more than just the members of Opec. Two of the world's leading producers are not going to be there: the US and China. Both countries have large oil production industries, but they use nearly all of it themselves, and have to import extra to meet their own needs. Their economies overall tend to benefit from cheaper oil so they don't have a shared interest with those who will be turning up in Doha. Still, there is more than enough oil production that will be represented there to make a substantial difference to the global market if the participants chose to take strong action. What many oil analysts say, however, is that they aren't talking about action that is going to achieve much. In the past, Opec has often managed to agree and deliver cuts in production. This time all that's on the table is a potential agreement to refrain from further increases. Among the countries attending there is certainly a good deal of support for the idea. But one important player, an Opec member, is determined to increase its production: Iran. As the country emerges from western sanctions, the Iranian government wants to regain the share of the market that it lost as a result of those restrictions on its international sales. Iran is not even sending its oil minister Bijan Zanganeh to the meeting, although another senior official is expected\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nThe price of oil has fallen to less than half of what it was in June 2014.

Archaeologist David Jacques, said: \"They... used the stump of the tree, about three metres high, as a wall.\" The finds are being shown to United Nations heritage experts, who are currently visiting Stonehenge. Archaeologists are concerned a planned 2.9km tunnel being considered for the nearby A303 main road will damage the site. Discoveries have also shown stones were warmed up by the Mesolithic Period inhabitants and used in a hearth to emit heat in the earthy snug. Mr Jacques, a senior research fellow at the University of Buckingham, has worked at Blick Mead for over a decade, making a number of discoveries about the inhabitants. The tree stump created a wall height similar to a \"modern bungalow\". \"They've draped probably animal skins or thatch around the basin and connected it to a post so it's a very comfortable snug little place,\" he said. The wooden wall of the hollow was lined with flints and the large earthy pit created by the tree root lined with cobbles and decorated with \"exotic\" stones from outside the area. \"There are some clever and sophisticated things going on, the hot stones that they put into this little type of alcove wouldn't have been on fire,\" explained Mr Jacques. \"It looks more like these people have been using these hot stones as a type of storage heater so that you've got a lot of warmth coming off them.\" Mr Jacques will meet the UN experts later to ask for the route to be moved closer to Salisbury and for hydrological assessments to be made. \"It's very likely the water flow would be reduced in and around the site,\" he said. \"It would take out all the organics and destroy all the animal bone we've been finding which is crucial for finding where they have been living and for getting radiocarbon dates from all the organics like pollen and wood. \"This is massively important for reconstructing what the landscape would have looked like.\" Andy Rhind-Tutt, former mayor and chairman of Amesbury Museum and Heritage Trust said: \"I sincerely hope the team delivering the long-awaited A303 improvement look seriously at an alternative alignment south of Salisbury and away from this unequalled archaeological landscape. \"It would be criminal to destroy such a rich heritage and connection with our ancestors for the sake of blocking the view to the passing public of Stonehenge.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type":

But critics say artists are still subject to tight censorship, pointing out that a South African gallery was forced to remove a painting of President Jacob Zuma under political pressure, while in Uganda a play about gay rights was banned. So, just how free are Africa's artists - in film, literature and music- to tell their own stories? Here are some of their experiences: Having been born and raised in Uganda, it was the best place to be. It was my home and my everything. I remember joining the film industry in 1999 - everything was still good. You didn't need a licence to shoot a film, no censor body to look at your script. All you had to do was get a camera, run to the streets, shoot something and lock yourself in the edit suite - and later put your work out there for the world to see. Today, I have grown to understand that not all stories can be told and not just any film can be done here. There are topics you have to think twice before tackling or which, for your safety, are better left untold. Topics that will get even actors saying: \"I think I am not the right person for that role\" even when you know they can pull it off. Here, you don't just wake up to say you are doing a film about the gay community, a film about the political situation, or a film that paints a bad picture of Uganda. One day I had to drop a story that was inspired by the practice of female genital mutilation amongst some communities in Uganda. I had strong interviews and had done thorough research, but everyone kept telling me it was not safe to go ahead. But it is still my home, my Uganda, my everything. I don't think anyone is free to exercise their art. And that includes artists. There is a cost for this freedom. Artists are no different to the entrepreneur in that financial resources are required for the capital outlay of the \"work\" or manuscript. Just to be in a position to indulge in the work is time spent creating a product without the immediate benefit of financial return. Then the work needs to be produced depending upon the format and genre, requiring additional resources. In the case of a writer, it is then given to a publisher, who spends even more resources to fine-tune the manuscript with an editor, proof reader, type setter, graphic designer etc. which could take considerable time before it is placed on the retail shelf. Since the work now becomes a joint investment, compromise is inevitable. So, I guess artists are free to tell their story if they have the resources to indulge in this freedom.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nAfrican artists are free to tell their own stories, but they have to have the resources to do so, and they have to be willing to compromise.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "A", "fr", "ican", "▁artists", "▁are", "▁free", "▁to", "▁tell", "▁their", "▁own", "▁stories", ",", "▁but", "▁they", "▁have", "▁to", "▁have", "▁the", "▁resources", "▁to", "▁do", "▁so", ",", "▁and", "▁they", "▁have", "▁to", "▁be", "▁willing", "▁to", "▁comprom", "ise", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁The", "▁", "1", "9", "7", "0", "s", "▁were", "▁a", "▁golden", "▁age", "▁for", "▁the", "▁music", "▁industry", ",", "▁and", "▁the", "▁de", "cade", "'", "s"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.04207852855324745, -0.0014067525044083595, -0.00036459474358707666, -0.0001515035255579278, -0.03623553365468979, -0.7090360522270203, -9.775113539944869e-06, -0.002971521345898509, -1.3470558769768104e-05, -0.36088523268699646, 0.0, -0.008621376007795334, -5.4238757002167404e-05, -0.10453367233276367, -0.35323163866996765, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -0.0031115233432501554, -0.0007269124034792185, -0.01043978612869978, -0.00018869050836656243, -0.0003094194398727268, -0.00015841660206206143, -0.2542264461517334, -0.12661300599575043, -0.0209214985370636, -0.6225316524505615, 0.0, -0.035208120942115784, -0.006774079520255327, 0.0, -0.0027808588929474354, 0.0, -0.08638539165258408, -0.015482589602470398, 0.0, -0.00040082051418721676, 0.0, 0.0, -1.7881377516459906e-06, 0.0, 0.0, -0.10208386927843094, -1.061408281326294, -0.25430741906166077, -0.013630766421556473, -0.4747714400291443, -0.10000047087669373, -1.4305104514278355e-06, -0.8531479239463806, -0.010767456144094467, -0.20898588001728058, -0.0007127366843633354, -0.010171247646212578, -0.047571055591106415, -0.41944944858551025, -0.04195896536111832, -0.508811354637146, -0.7719916701316833, -0.2927914261817932, -0.16919280588626862, 0.0, -0.6725496053695679, 0.0], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "A": -0.04207852855324745, "fr": -0.0014067525044083595, "ican": -0.00036459474358707666, "▁artists": -0.0001515035255579278, "▁are": -0.03623553365468979, "▁free": -0.7090360522270203, "▁to": 0.0, "▁tell": -0.002971521345898509, "▁their": -1.3470558769768104e-05, "▁own": -0.36088523268699646, "▁stories": 0.0, ",": -0.508811354637146, "▁but": -5.4238757002167404e-05, "▁they": -0.0209214985370636, "▁have": -0.6225316524505615, "▁the": -0.2927914261817932, "▁resources": -0.01043978612869978, "▁do": -0.0003094194398727268, "▁so": -0.00015841660206206143, "▁and": -0.7719916701316833, "▁be": -0.035208120942115784, "▁willing": -0.006774079520255327, "▁comprom": -0.0027808588929474354, "ise": 0.0, ".": -0.08638539165258408, "##": -0.00040082051418721676, "#": 0.0, "Art": -1.7881377516459906e-06, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "▁The": -0.10208386927843094, "▁": -1.061408281326294, "1": -0.25430741906166077, "9": -0.013630766421556473, "7": -0.4747714400291443, "0": -0.10000047087669373, "s": 0.0, "▁were": -0.8531479239463806, "▁a": -0.010767456144094467, "▁golden": -0.20898588001728058, "▁age": -0.0007127366843633354, "▁for": -0.010171247646212578, "▁music": -0.41944944858551025, "▁industry": -0.04195896536111832, "▁de": -0.16919280588626862, "cade": 0.0, "'": -0.6725496053695679}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

They say interest in the 23 June poll is high although the campaign is perceived as being dominated by \"old men shouting at each other\". Young people are twice as likely not to be signed up as the public at large. In five weeks' time, the UK will decide whether it should remain a member of the European Union or not, with British citizens aged 18 and over and specified others entitled to vote. It will be the first public vote on the country's future in Europe for more than 50 years. Amid concerns about levels of youth turnout, efforts are being stepped up to encourage young people to sign up to vote in time to take part. Those who registered ahead of the local and national elections on 5 May do not need to re-register. The #TurnUp campaign, which launches on 31 May, is focused on getting young voters to encourage their friends and colleagues to sign up at events in universities, youth clubs, workplaces and cafes. A survey of 1,300 18-30 year olds carried out by YouGov suggests 51% are closely following the referendum, 39% are not while 10% are avoiding coverage of it altogether. While the majority - 52% - of those polled said the economy was the most important issue in determining how to vote, the research found low levels of trust in those representing either side in the referendum debate. Only 10% of those canvassed trusted politicians to make the case for either a Remain or Leave vote, while the figures for the media (13%) and business leaders (16%) were only slightly higher. In contrast, teachers and academics scored much higher levels of trust (72%) as did other young people (50%). Bite the Ballot's director Mike Sani said it was vital the campaign was not merely the preserve of politicians and business people. \"We need to act now to ensure those unregistered are empowered and inspired to take a role in the decision-making process,\" he said. \"Young people will be living longest with the outcome and the risk of not engaging them in the issue is too big to ignore.\" And Hope not Hate said there would be serious consequences if young people were shut out of the debate. \"It is vital they get registered but also vital for both Remain and Leave campaigners to address the concerns of the young far more directly,\" said its chief executive Nick Lowles. \"We know that if they don't, and the voices of the young are not heard, disaffection can breed alienation. That in turn can act as a potent lure for extremists and others who would divide society.\" The groups say 30% of all 18-24 year olds are not registered to vote at the moment and, of those who signed up to vote in last year's general election, only 54% ended up voting - much lower than other age groups.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nTwo campaign groups are aiming to sign up 500,000 young people to vote in the EU referendum.

Nadal, 28, made his announcement after losing 6-2 7-6 (7-4) to Croatian teenager Borna Coric in the quarter-finals of the Swiss Indoors on Friday. \"I'm not going to Paris and London - I'm not competitive enough,\" the nine-time French Open champion said. \"I am going to have surgery on 3 November.\" Nadal had already qualified for the ATP World Tour Finals event, so the Spaniard's withdrawal means the player ranked ninth in the final ATP Race to London rankings will make it through to the season-ending event at the O2 in Greenwich. Britain's Andy Murray will compete in next week's Paris Masters, which is the final ranking event of the season. The Scot, 27, currently lies in eighth position in the Race to London standings. The Swiss Indoors in Basel was just the third tournament Nadal had played since Wimbledon following a wrist injury, and he revealed earlier this month that he was on a course of antibiotics for his appendix.

A judge ruled there was nothing in the 1998 Good Friday peace agreement to prevent the government triggering Article 50, the formal legal process for leaving the EU. The UK government welcomed the ruling. Mr McCord said that \"without a doubt\" he would be taking his case to the Supreme Court. \"The judge has left the door open,\" he said. \"We're right in what we're doing for the people of this country.\" The challenge by politicians from Sinn FÃ©in, the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), the Alliance Party and the Green Party suggested the UK government could not trigger Article 50 without a parliamentary vote. They said the Brexit decision should be examined and voted on by parliament or, failing that, by the Northern Ireland Assembly. Earlier this month, the High Court in London heard that the need for parliament to give its approval before the Brexit process starts is of huge \"constitutional importance\". Mr McCord, whose son was murdered by loyalist paramilitaries and who now campaigns for victims of violence during Northern Ireland's Troubles, brought Friday's other legal bid. His challenge came amid worries that the Brexit vote could mean an end to EU funding for peace projects that help Troubles victims. His lawyer argued that the Good Friday Agreement meant Westminster had given sovereignty of Northern Ireland over to its people, and that leaving the EU would have a \"catastrophic effect\" for the peace process. Major constitutional changes such as leaving the EU could not therefore be imposed by a Westminster government, Mr McCord's barrister said. But the judge ruled that prerogative power could still be used, arguing that triggering Article 50 is merely the start of a legislative process in which acts of parliament will be necessary. \"While the wind of change may be about to blow, the precise direction in which it will blows cannot be determined,\" he said. He concluded that discussing the use of prerogative power to enact the EU referendum result was not suitable for a judicial review. It had also been argued that the Good Friday Agreement gave the power of sovereignty to the people of Northern Ireland and that the Westminster government could not therefore make the region leave the EU. But the judge rejected that argument as well, saying he could not see anything in the agreement or the relevant legislation that confirmed that view. All of the issues raised by the applicants were rejected by the court. The pound dropped in the wake of the ruling, with analysts speculating that it had weighed on the currency. Sinn FÃ©in's John O'Down said Remain-supporting politicians would \"continue to explore every legal and political option open to us\" to ensure that citizens' rights are \"protected and upheld\". SDLP leader Colum Eastwood acknowledged that the cost of taking the case to the Supreme Court could be an issue.

He was convicted and sentenced to death. But he was reprieved a few years later after new evidence appeared. But back in America, decades later, an immigration judge ruled there was enough evidence to prove he had been a guard at other Nazi camps, and he was sent abroad for trial again in 2009. The Munich case, in which he was given a five-year jail sentence, is expected to be Germany's last big war crimes trial. Born Ivan Demjanjuk on 3 April 1920 in the Ukrainian village of Dubovi Makharintsi, he was raised under Soviet rule. A burly man, he worked as a tractor and lorry driver on a Ukrainian collective farm. Little can be said with certainty about Mr Demjanjuk's activities during World War II. He joined the Red Army like millions of others, and was serving in eastern Crimea in 1942 when he was captured by the Germans. At least three million Soviet soldiers are believed by historians to have died in German prison camps, many of them left to starve. \"I would have given my soul for a loaf of bread,\" Mr Demjanjuk said later in court. At his trial in Israel, he testified that he had been held at a camp in Chelmno, Poland, until 1944 before being moved to another camp in Austria where he joined a Nazi-backed unit of Russian soldiers fighting communist rule. But according to German prosecutors, between March and September 1943, he was in fact involved in the murders of tens of thousands of Jews at the Nazis' Sobibor death camp in Poland. They said they had obtained hundreds of documents and a number of prosecution witnesses. \"For the first time we have even found lists of names of the people who Demjanjuk personally led into the gas chambers,\" said Kurt Schrimm, head of the special office investigating Nazi crimes. After the war, Demjanjuk lived in southern Germany, working as a driver for various international refugee organisations, according to Germany's Spiegel magazine. In 1952, he emigrated to the US with his wife and child, eventually settling in Cleveland, where he worked as an engine mechanic at a car plant. He was naturalised as a US citizen but his citizenship was temporarily removed after a US judge ruled in 1981 that he had lied in his citizenship application about his wartime activities. Israeli prosecutors requested his extradition in 1983. They believed Mr Demjanjuk was Ivan the Terrible - one of the most infamous guards at Treblinka. Ivan had helped operate the gas chambers and personally murdered hundreds of prisoners, hacking many of his naked victims to death with a sword, according to witnesses. A US court rejected his appeal against deportation in 1985. The court dismissed doubts cast over the authenticity of an ID card, which the defence said was a forgery. The card showed that Mr Demjanjuk belonged to\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nIvan Demjanjuk, a Ukrainian-born US citizen, was convicted of being a Nazi death camp guard and sentenced to death in Israel.

Crawley, who were relegated from League One earlier this month, had been without a manager since John Gregory left the West Sussex club on 9 May. \"My job is to put a competitive squad together that will challenge at the right end of the table,\" 45-year-old Yates told the Crawley website. He spent almost five years in charge of Cheltenham and guided them to the League Two play-offs in 2012 and 2013. After successive top-seven finishes and unsuccessful play-off campaigns, Cheltenham finished 17th in League Two in 2013-14. And ex-Kidderminster boss Yates was then sacked late last year, following a run of four successive league defeats that left them 18th. He was the third-longest serving manager in England's top four divisions at the time of his departure from Whaddon Road. \"I have been out of the game for a few months and when this opportunity came up it really excited me,\" he said. \"There's a big challenge ahead but one I am really looking forward to.\" Gregory, 60, parted company with Crawley earlier this month, having spent the past six months recuperating from heart surgery. Dean Saunders was placed in interim charge of the Reds in December, but was unable to save the club from the drop to League Two. The 50-year-old former Liverpool and Aston Villa striker was appointed Chesterfield manager last week. Crawley chief executive Michael Dunford said that Yates stood out among \"some very strong candidates\". He added: \"He has a very deep knowledge of the level we find ourselves at next season and is a first-rate coach. \"The board spoke to several people in the game who have worked with Mark and they were all very positive about his credentials, his knowledge and his enthusiasm.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nCrawley have appointed Mark Yates as their new manager.  \n\nOutput: Crawley have appointed Mark Yates as their new manager.  \n\n[INST] 2 / 2Write an article with the title: \"Crawley have appointed Mark Yates as their new manager.", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "C", "raw", "ley", "▁have", "▁appointed", "▁Mark", "▁Y", "ates", "▁as", "▁their", "▁new", "▁manager", ".", "▁▁", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "Output", ":", "▁C", "raw", "ley", "▁have", "▁appointed", "▁Mark", "▁Y", "ates", "▁as", "▁their", "▁new", "▁manager", ".", "▁▁", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "[", "INST", "]", "▁", "2", "▁/", "▁", "2", "Write", "▁an", "▁article", "▁with", "▁the", "▁title", ":", "▁\"", "C", "raw", "ley", "▁have", "▁appointed", "▁Mark", "▁Y", "ates", "▁as", "▁their", "▁new", "▁manager", ".\""], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.37655067443847656, 0.0, 0.0, -0.4650682806968689, -0.00023052419419400394, -0.015406995080411434, 0.0, 0.0, -3.1709168979432434e-05, -0.0012747265864163637, -0.004433089401572943, -0.0005529781919904053, -0.7024418711662292, -0.5581891536712646, 0.0, 0.0, -0.5955501198768616, 0.0, -0.0008985534077510238, 0.0, 0.0, -0.05270092934370041, -2.1934269170742482e-05, -7.152555099310121e-07, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -2.3841855067985307e-07, 0.0, -0.07889514416456223, -1.0371154530730564e-05, 0.0, 0.0, -0.004450654145330191, -1.1920928244535389e-07, 0.0, -0.7187426686286926, -0.1575746387243271, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.7413960695266724, -0.5064901113510132, -6.9141146923357155e-06, -0.0002411313180346042, -0.0003946240758523345, -0.18081146478652954, -0.05274401232600212, -0.11299548298120499, -0.45901212096214294, -0.0007175016799010336, 0.0, -0.023098915815353394, -1.966933996300213e-05, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.03636302426457405], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "C": -0.45901212096214294, "raw": -0.0007175016799010336, "ley": 0.0, "▁have": -0.023098915815353394, "▁appointed": -1.966933996300213e-05, "▁Mark": 0.0, "▁Y": 0.0, "ates": 0.0, "▁as": 0.0, "▁their": 0.0, "▁new": 0.0, "▁manager": 0.0, ".": -0.07889514416456223, "▁▁": -1.0371154530730564e-05, "Output": -0.5955501198768616, ":": -0.05274401232600212, "▁C": -0.0008985534077510238, "[": -0.004450654145330191, "INST": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "]": 0.0, "▁": 0.0, "2": 0.0, "▁/": 0.0, "Write": -0.7413960695266724, "▁an": -0.5064901113510132, "▁article": -6.9141146923357155e-06, "▁with": -0.0002411313180346042, "▁the": -0.0003946240758523345, "▁title": -0.18081146478652954, "▁\"": -0.11299548298120499, ".\"": -0.03636302426457405}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

A European commissioner has warned the British government that it needs to make a strategic choice - whether it wants to stay inside the single market or not. Valdis Dombrovskis, commissioner for the euro, told the BBC there had been mixed messages from Mrs May's government - on the one hand wanting to stay in the internal market, on the other had not respecting freedom of movement. Mrs May has made it clear she wants some curbs on immigration from the EU. But Mr Dombrovskis told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend there can't be cherry picking, and the commission is waiting for a formal notification of what the UK wants. He was speaking at a conference in Italy organised by an Italian think tank called the European House - Ambrosetti. It is like a European Davos, a gathering of business leaders and bankers, politicians past and present - in short, the European elite. Most of the sessions are private but we spoke to a number of senior figures on the record. Former Irish Taoiseach John Bruton expressed incredulity that Mrs May doesn't want to start negotiations until next year. \"There's a lot of surprise in European capitals that a party that had promised a referendum in its manifesto hadn't decided in advance what it would look for if people voted to leave,\" he said. \"One would have thought they would have prepared, but they don't appear to have done that.\" Former head of the European Central Bank Jean-Claude Trichet told us there would be a period of uncertainty. \"I would call for this period to be as short as possible, and for the position of the British government to be as clear as possible, as soon as possible,\" he said. Greek Economy Minister Giorgos Stathakis told us: \"The hard part of the story is that the EU is quite strict - free trade means free movement, it is difficult to find a compromise.\" I asked him if he would back such a compromise. \"We wouldn't - whatever compromises take place will include reduction in access to trade,\" he said. Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, leading plans for Brexit alongside Angela Merkel and Francois Hollande, has let it be known that he hopes the UK can become the EU's \"best friend\". But he's warned the split-up should happen as soon as possible - and it will be impossible for the UK to keep all the advantages of membership. Former Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti told me that if Britain was given concessions over free movement it would mean the end of the free market. He said he would swear on oath that other countries would also want to cherry pick, and that would be devastating and lead to the collapse of the single market. He also said there could be one positive outcome from the \"disgraceful\" Brexit - other leaders may be warned off attacking the EU to strengthen\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nThe EU is warning the UK government that it needs to make a strategic choice - whether it wants to stay in the internal market or not.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "The", "▁EU", "▁is", "▁warning", "▁the", "▁UK", "▁government", "▁that", "▁it", "▁needs", "▁to", "▁make", "▁a", "▁strateg", "ic", "▁choice", "▁-", "▁whether", "▁it", "▁wants", "▁to", "▁stay", "▁in", "▁the", "▁internal", "▁market", "▁or", "▁not", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁The", "▁UK", "▁government", "▁has", "▁published", "▁its", "▁long", "-", "await", "ed", "▁white", "▁paper", "▁on", "▁Bre", "x", "it", ",", "▁setting", "▁out", "▁its", "▁vision", "▁for", "▁the", "▁future", "▁relationship", "▁between"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.05846721678972244, -0.08343204110860825, -0.007678162306547165, -0.7216486930847168, -0.04190924018621445, -0.03506126254796982, -0.7191511392593384, -0.030629463493824005, -0.0033999038860201836, -0.027426475659012794, -2.3841855067985307e-07, -0.01166098564863205, -0.010198977775871754, -0.01955399103462696, 0.0, -6.890059739816934e-05, -0.44848746061325073, -1.7881377516459906e-06, -1.0371154530730564e-05, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.36088407039642334, 0.0, -0.11735103279352188, 0.0, -1.1920928244535389e-07, 0.0, -0.0013613966293632984, -0.11837752908468246, 0.0, -8.940656698541716e-06, 0.0, 0.0, -1.0728830375228426e-06, 0.0, 0.0, -0.03753795102238655, -0.21880725026130676, -0.009351381100714207, -0.3677230179309845, -0.21160376071929932, -0.6947721242904663, -0.009144330397248268, -0.011117890477180481, -1.1920922133867862e-06, 0.0, -0.19505508244037628, 0.0, -0.002156077418476343, -0.12334979325532913, 0.0, 0.0, -0.173719123005867, -0.025667419657111168, 0.0, -0.023522840812802315, -0.10855650901794434, -0.0029240967705845833, -0.07823745906352997, -0.016637740656733513, -0.0005455912905745208, -0.11735209077596664], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "The": -0.05846721678972244, "▁EU": -0.08343204110860825, "▁is": -0.007678162306547165, "▁warning": -0.7216486930847168, "▁the": -0.07823745906352997, "▁UK": -0.21880725026130676, "▁government": -0.009351381100714207, "▁that": -0.030629463493824005, "▁it": -1.0371154530730564e-05, "▁needs": -0.027426475659012794, "▁to": 0.0, "▁make": -0.01166098564863205, "▁a": -0.010198977775871754, "▁strateg": -0.01955399103462696, "ic": 0.0, "▁choice": -6.890059739816934e-05, "▁-": -0.44848746061325073, "▁whether": -1.7881377516459906e-06, "▁wants": 0.0, "▁stay": 0.0, "▁in": -0.36088407039642334, "▁internal": -0.11735103279352188, "▁market": 0.0, "▁or": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "▁not": 0.0, ".": -0.0013613966293632984, "##": -8.940656698541716e-06, "#": 0.0, "Art": -1.0728830375228426e-06, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "▁The": -0.03753795102238655, "▁has": -0.3677230179309845, "▁published": -0.21160376071929932, "▁its": -0.023522840812802315, "▁long": -0.009144330397248268, "-": -0.011117890477180481, "await": -1.1920922133867862e-06, "ed": 0.0, "▁white": -0.19505508244037628, "▁paper": 0.0, "▁on": -0.002156077418476343, "▁Bre": -0.12334979325532913, "x": 0.0, "it": 0.0, ",": -0.173719123005867, "▁setting": -0.025667419657111168, "▁out": 0.0, "▁vision": -0.10855650901794434, "▁for": -0.0029240967705845833, "▁future": -0.016637740656733513, "▁relationship": -0.0005455912905745208, "▁between": -0.11735209077596664}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

More on this and other Lincolnshire stories. The type of rescues logged by the fire service included removing bedroom doors and banisters, to using lifting equipment to help patients from their homes into ambulances. Spencer Creek, technical response manger for the service said that more than 60 firefighters had taken the specialist training course. \"What we are looking at now is how the guys practically deal with the weight of the casualty,\" he said. \"And how do we deal with it in a number of different scenarios.\" As well as the training, the service has invested in specialist equipment including, inflatable chairs and strengthened stretchers at the cost of Â£3,000 per fire engine. East Midlands Ambulance Service has equipped all its ambulances with stretchers capable of holding patients weighing up to 30 stones (190kg).\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nFirefighters in Lincolnshire are being trained to deal with overweight patients.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "Fire", "fig", "h", "ters", "▁in", "▁Lincoln", "shire", "▁are", "▁being", "▁trained", "▁to", "▁deal", "▁with", "▁over", "weight", "▁patients", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁The", "▁", "2", "0", "1", "7", "▁event", "▁will", "▁be", "▁the", "▁", "1", "3", "th", "▁annual", "▁T", "ough", "▁M", "ud", "der", ",", "▁which", "▁has", "▁been", "▁held", "▁in", "▁the", "▁UK", "▁and", "▁Europe", "▁since", "▁", "2", "0", "1", "0", ".", "▁The"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.7404984831809998, -0.00021109737281221896, 0.0, 0.0, -0.005091083236038685, -0.022131837904453278, 0.0, -0.08602941781282425, -0.09772949665784836, -0.00498587591573596, -0.0006574614671990275, -0.3427962362766266, 0.0, -0.6589393019676208, -7.152555099310121e-07, -0.033463865518569946, -0.023765234276652336, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.11900363117456436, -0.1599155068397522, -0.29714101552963257, -0.07768391072750092, -0.002551040844991803, -0.7619481682777405, -0.9547675848007202, -0.09642570465803146, -0.11844932287931442, -0.25199463963508606, -0.5198078155517578, -0.11993633955717087, -0.7868199348449707, -1.811964830267243e-05, -1.1923409700393677, -1.2538779973983765, -1.0496540069580078, -2.3841855067985307e-07, 0.0, 0.0, -0.39789479970932007, -0.11124397069215775, -0.2937557101249695, -0.6035115122795105, -0.09073435515165329, -0.004711834713816643, -0.0688132494688034, -0.00799337588250637, -0.578845202922821, -0.412201464176178, -0.08116517215967178, -1.7881377516459906e-06, 0.0, 0.0, -4.768370445162873e-07, -0.07476843148469925, -0.0052979071624577045, -0.2816874086856842], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "Fire": -0.7404984831809998, "fig": -0.00021109737281221896, "h": 0.0, "ters": 0.0, "▁in": -0.004711834713816643, "▁Lincoln": -0.022131837904453278, "shire": 0.0, "▁are": -0.08602941781282425, "▁being": -0.09772949665784836, "▁trained": -0.00498587591573596, "▁to": -0.0006574614671990275, "▁deal": -0.3427962362766266, "▁with": 0.0, "▁over": -0.6589393019676208, "weight": -7.152555099310121e-07, "▁patients": -0.033463865518569946, ".": -0.0052979071624577045, "##": 0.0, "#": 0.0, "Art": 0.0, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "▁The": -0.2816874086856842, "▁": -1.7881377516459906e-06, "2": 0.0, "0": -0.07476843148469925, "1": -4.768370445162873e-07, "7": -0.7619481682777405, "▁event": -0.9547675848007202, "▁will": -0.09642570465803146, "▁be": -0.11844932287931442, "▁the": -0.0688132494688034, "3": -0.7868199348449707, "th": -1.811964830267243e-05, "▁annual": -1.1923409700393677, "▁T": -1.2538779973983765, "ough": -1.0496540069580078, "▁M": -2.3841855067985307e-07, "ud": 0.0, "der": 0.0, ",": -0.39789479970932007, "▁which": -0.11124397069215775, "▁has": -0.2937557101249695, "▁been": -0.6035115122795105, "▁held": -0.09073435515165329, "▁UK": -0.00799337588250637, "▁and": -0.578845202922821, "▁Europe": -0.412201464176178, "▁since": -0.08116517215967178}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

Ian Hosking, an expert in design for the elderly at the University of Cambridge's engineering design centre, believes we need to get the basics right first. \"There are some very tech-savvy older people around, but there is clearly a large cohort of people who feel excluded by technology. They find it a bit impenetrable,\" he says. I would probably include my mother in that latter category. She is in her 80s and has made valiant efforts to get to grips with a wide range of technology, from a creaking hand-me-down computer to a Kindle and online shopping. Now, she wants to buy a tablet but is worried that she will not know how to use it. She is not alone - according to the US Pew Internet research centre, 77% of older people would need someone to help walk them through the process of setting up a new device. Aimed specifically at the older generation, Breezie offers a simplified interface for a standard Samsung Galaxy tablet. It can be customised to make sure it has the settings and apps the customer wants, rather than a bunch of preset ones they will never use. And the ones they do have are made easy to use - so, for example, someone wanting to use Skype simply has to tap on a friend's picture in the address book. Company founder Jeh Kazimi told BBC News Breezie had been inspired by his own mother. \"I watched her trying to navigate the internet and saw that she found it intimidating and complicated,\" he says. \"I couldn't find anything on the market that could make the internet work for her, so I created it myself.\" \"Our goal was to design software that makes the online environment considerably more accessible for people with little or no technological nous and to do so without patronising or limiting them.\" Users can give a trusted relative or friend the ability to sign-in remotely, set-up accounts and add contacts, via Breezie's support service. Last year it teamed up with Age UK to launch the tablet, which costs Â£299 with the Breezie platform pre-installed. It is easy to assume that older people will find a gadget as simple to use as you do. As an iPad user, I saw no reason my mother could not get to grips with it - but, actually, it is not as simple as that. The response time for icons on an Apple screen is 0.7 seconds, but the over-65s have a response time of about one second. Using touchscreens may come naturally enough to a toddler but not necessarily for an older person - the nerves in the finger become less sensitive with age, meaning older people may \"touch\" far more heavily. And tests suggest that if an older person has a slight tremor, it can be registered on a device as a swipe rather than a touch. \"It is\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nA new tablet is being launched to help older people use technology.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "A", "▁new", "▁table", "t", "▁is", "▁being", "▁launched", "▁to", "▁help", "▁older", "▁people", "▁use", "▁technology", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁The", "▁UK", "▁government", "▁has", "▁launched", "▁a", "▁new", "▁campaign", "▁to", "▁encou", "rage", "▁older", "▁people", "▁to", "▁use", "▁the", "▁internet", ".", "▁The", "▁campaign", ",", "▁called", "▁\"", "Get", "▁Online", "\"", "▁and", "▁run", "▁by", "▁the", "▁Department", "▁for", "▁Work", "▁and", "▁P", "ensions", ",", "▁a", "ims", "▁to", "▁help"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.06241917237639427, -0.050589125603437424, -0.010505612008273602, 0.0, -0.558904230594635, -0.007146983873099089, -0.06587141007184982, -1.2164034843444824, -0.05297547206282616, -0.25267377495765686, -3.0040289857424796e-05, -0.36293351650238037, -0.07909959554672241, -0.2325984537601471, -8.237022848334163e-05, 0.0, -4.768370445162873e-07, 0.0, 0.0, -1.4305104514278355e-06, 0.0, 0.0, -0.09509928524494171, -0.9585713148117065, -0.1100747361779213, -0.17630842328071594, -0.729694664478302, -0.0010268182959407568, -0.1304512768983841, -0.2954355478286743, -0.0049149408005177975, -0.11038585752248764, 0.0, -0.847827672958374, -7.438383181579411e-05, -2.50339189733495e-06, -0.2744233310222626, -0.3624436557292938, -8.702239938429557e-06, -0.11928225308656693, -0.017293613404035568, -0.0911303460597992, -0.128184512257576, -0.015479655005037785, -0.1039956733584404, -0.00023314618738368154, -0.00255651050247252, -0.279574453830719, -0.864222526550293, -0.07969661056995392, -0.004456113558262587, -0.027771933004260063, -0.00020954797219019383, -0.17300845682621002, -0.21782509982585907, -2.50339189733495e-06, 0.0, 0.0, -0.004680036101490259, -0.8962796330451965, 0.0, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -0.15117761492729187], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "A": -0.06241917237639427, "▁new": -0.1304512768983841, "▁table": -0.010505612008273602, "t": 0.0, "▁is": -0.558904230594635, "▁being": -0.007146983873099089, "▁launched": -0.729694664478302, "▁to": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "▁help": -0.15117761492729187, "▁older": -0.847827672958374, "▁people": -7.438383181579411e-05, "▁use": -0.2744233310222626, "▁technology": -0.07909959554672241, ".": -0.11928225308656693, "##": -4.768370445162873e-07, "#": 0.0, "Art": -1.4305104514278355e-06, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "▁The": -0.017293613404035568, "▁UK": -0.9585713148117065, "▁government": -0.1100747361779213, "▁has": -0.17630842328071594, "▁a": -0.8962796330451965, "▁campaign": -0.0911303460597992, "▁encou": -0.11038585752248764, "rage": 0.0, "▁the": -0.027771933004260063, "▁internet": -8.702239938429557e-06, ",": -0.004680036101490259, "▁called": -0.015479655005037785, "▁\"": -0.1039956733584404, "Get": -0.00023314618738368154, "▁Online": -0.00255651050247252, "\"": -0.279574453830719, "▁and": -2.50339189733495e-06, "▁run": -0.07969661056995392, "▁by": -0.004456113558262587, "▁Department": -0.00020954797219019383, "▁for": -0.17300845682621002, "▁Work": -0.21782509982585907, "▁P": 0.0, "ensions": 0.0, "ims": 0.0}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

But their son woke up and after seeing his mother's body wrapped in a rug, showed police where it happened. The family has been speaking ahead of a documentary about the murder case. The body of Ms Hemming - who shared a surname with her partner but they were not married - was found in Hertfordshire woodland three weeks after she disappeared. More news from Buckinghamshire She was reported missing two days after she vanished by her mother, who voiced concerns to police about Hemming. Hemming, 43, who had murdered her after hearing she was having an affair, was jailed for at least 20 years in November. Ms Hemming's sisters Kerry Hammond and Joanne Beverley have told the BBC Hemming was a \"very charming, smiley, happy guy that could quite frankly sell ice to Eskimos\". However, he was a manipulative and controlling man with a violent temper who could \"go off the handle\". She once needed hospital treatment after he threw a phone at her head. The violence culminated in the killing of Ms Hemming at the hands of her partner, some of which was witnessed by the couple's son. \"He's sitting on that chair swinging his legs and he just blurts out this whole little story about unfortunately seeing mummy wrapped in a rug,\" his aunt Ms Beverley said. \"He drew this map of the living room and he showed them where he'd seen Paul cleaning the floor and actually that is exactly where they found the evidence that they needed to be able to charge him.\" A year after the murder, the child was finally coming to terms with what his father had done, Ms Hammond said. The story of how Hemming became the subject of a murder inquiry before his victim's body was found, is told in a Channel 4 documentary Catching a Killer, to be shown at 21:00 BST.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nA man who beat his partner to death in front of their children was jailed for at least 20 years.  \n\n[INST] Write an article with the given title: \"A woman who was jailed for 10 years for killing her husband in a row over a missing packet of bi", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "A", "▁man", "▁who", "▁beat", "▁his", "▁partner", "▁to", "▁death", "▁in", "▁front", "▁of", "▁their", "▁children", "▁was", "▁ja", "iled", "▁for", "▁at", "▁least", "▁", "2", "0", "▁years", ".", "▁▁", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "[", "INST", "]", "▁Write", "▁an", "▁article", "▁with", "▁the", "▁given", "▁title", ":", "▁\"", "A", "▁woman", "▁who", "▁was", "▁ja", "iled", "▁for", "▁", "1", "0", "▁years", "▁for", "▁killing", "▁her", "▁husband", "▁in", "▁a", "▁row", "▁over", "▁a", "▁missing", "▁packet", "▁of", "▁bis"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.0067653171718120575, -0.010035298764705658, -0.903599739074707, -0.978468656539917, -1.9073468138230965e-06, -4.0531076592742465e-06, -8.344646857949556e-07, 0.0, -0.10442467778921127, -0.0027995225973427296, 0.0, -0.00010156115604331717, -0.002879285253584385, -0.1535876840353012, -7.915183232398704e-05, 0.0, -1.537788011773955e-05, -0.0033049744088202715, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.5296881198883057, -0.5566276907920837, 0.0, -3.2186455882765586e-06, -0.04094943404197693, 0.0, 0.0, -0.5653301477432251, -0.0067444778978824615, -1.5735502529423684e-05, -3.0397906812140718e-05, -0.0008386432309634984, -0.04630998894572258, 0.0, 0.0, -0.0014581772265955806, -0.7930068969726562, -0.027309557422995567, -0.03816259279847145, -0.16878749430179596, -0.5374037623405457, 0.0, -0.00026592056383378804, -0.8951537013053894, -0.023636827245354652, -0.0833553746342659, -0.05395543575286865, -0.005784675944596529, -0.4315381348133087, -0.015392674133181572, -0.15431095659732819, -0.32330387830734253, -0.004871404729783535, -1.051910161972046, -0.0014332984574139118, -0.08477521687746048, -0.07998386770486832, -0.954852819442749, 0.0, -0.5064533352851868], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": -3.2186455882765586e-06, "A": -0.7930068969726562, "▁man": -0.010035298764705658, "▁who": -0.03816259279847145, "▁beat": -0.978468656539917, "▁his": -1.9073468138230965e-06, "▁partner": -4.0531076592742465e-06, "▁to": -8.344646857949556e-07, "▁death": 0.0, "▁in": -0.32330387830734253, "▁front": -0.0027995225973427296, "▁of": 0.0, "▁their": -0.00010156115604331717, "▁children": -0.002879285253584385, "▁was": -0.16878749430179596, "▁ja": -0.5374037623405457, "iled": 0.0, "▁for": -0.005784675944596529, "▁at": -0.0033049744088202715, "▁least": 0.0, "▁": -0.8951537013053894, "2": 0.0, "0": -0.0833553746342659, "▁years": -0.05395543575286865, ".": -0.5296881198883057, "▁▁": -0.5566276907920837, "[": -0.04094943404197693, "INST": 0.0, "]": 0.0, "▁Write": -0.5653301477432251, "▁an": -0.0067444778978824615, "▁article": -1.5735502529423684e-05, "▁with": -3.0397906812140718e-05, "▁the": -0.0008386432309634984, "▁given": -0.04630998894572258, "▁title": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "▁\"": -0.0014581772265955806, "▁woman": -0.027309557422995567, "1": -0.023636827245354652, "▁killing": -0.4315381348133087, "▁her": -0.015392674133181572, "▁husband": -0.15431095659732819, "▁a": -0.08477521687746048, "▁row": -1.051910161972046, "▁over": -0.0014332984574139118, "▁missing": -0.07998386770486832, "▁packet": -0.954852819442749, "▁bis": -0.5064533352851868}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

But Fred Warmbier said his son had been treated \"brutally\". He spoke as an Ohio hospital said Otto had suffered a \"severe neurological injury\" and is in a stable condition. \"We went for 15 months without a word from or about Otto,\" Mr Warmbier said of his son, who fought back tears at Thursday's press conference in Cincinnati, Ohio. \"It was only a week ago that the North Korean government now claims that he was in a coma for almost all of that time. \"Even if you believe their explanation of botulism and a sleeping pill causing the coma - and we don't - there's no excuse for a civilised nation to have kept his condition secret and to have denied him top notch medical care.\" Otto Warmbier, an economics student from the University of Virginia, was arrested in January 2016 while visiting North Korea as a tourist. Botulism is a type of poisoning which can cause total body paralysis, difficulty in breathing and death in some cases. It's caused by the clostridium botulinum bacteria, but the symptoms of botulism are not from the bacteria themselves. Instead, the microscopic organisms produce a powerful toxin which attacks the nervous system and causes paralysis. That poison is called botulinum - which you may know for its commercial use in Botox, which removes wrinkles by paralysing facial muscles. Botulism is contracted in two ways in adults - by eating food contaminated with the toxin, or through wounds. The foodborne method happens when the bacteria are tinned or stored in food in another way that deprives them from air (which is when they produce the poison). This rarely happens in modern western food production, but is what North Korea claims happened to Mr Warmbier. He was given a 15-year prison sentence for attempting to steal a propaganda sign from a hotel. Fred Warmbier told reporters his son had been held as a \"war criminal'. He said he and his wife, Cindy, had relied \"on this false premise that they would treat Otto fairly and let him go\". In honour of his son, Fred Warmbier wore the same jacket Otto was wearing when he was paraded before media to tearfully confess to attempting to take the sign as a \"trophy\" for a US church. Mr Warmbier also appeared to criticise the Obama administration for failing to help secure his son's release. How harsh is prison in North Korea? \"When Otto was first taken we were advised by the past administration to take a low profile while they worked to obtain his release,\" he said. \"We did so without result. Earlier this year Cindy and I decided the time for strategic patience was over.\" The university student was freed hours after US basketball star Dennis Rodman arrived in North Korea, but Fred Warmbier said the professional athlete's visit had nothing to do with his son's release.

Gavin Chambers, an RSPB warden, tweeted pictures of vivid green in the sky over Lake Vyrnwy in Powys, Wales, saying: \"Well worth getting back out of bed for!!\" Donna Butcher tweeted: \"Just been watching an amazing display of Aurora from Staveley, Cumbria.

Rescuers found Sophia and Poppy 200m from a dam on the family's property. The Australian Broadcasting Corp. quoted Sophia's grandmother, Vera Cook, who credited the dog with saving the toddler's life.

By the time of its liberation, almost half the prisoners had died. The Nazis built and tested one of their first gas chambers at the camp. France has been grappling with rising attacks on both Jews and Muslims after deadly shootings by Islamist gunmen in January, sparking fresh debate about growing social tensions, says the BBC's Lucy Williamson in Paris. Commemorations have also been held in northern Germany to mark the 70th anniversary of the liberation of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, where an estimated 70,000 people were killed, including the young Jewish diarist Anne Frank. The president of the World Jewish Congress, Ronald Lauder, remembered the first shocking images to emerge from the camp. \"We saw the bulldozers pushing naked bodies into open pits,\" he said, according to AFP news agency. He remembered \"the walking skeletons, the unbelievable sadness and loss,\" at a ceremony attended by about 70 survivors. Another emotional ceremony took place at the site of another camp - Jasenovac in Croatia - to mark the 70th anniversary of an escape attempt by about 600 inmates. Only 80 or 90 inmates escaped, with the rest shot by guards.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nFrance's President Francois Hollande has led commemorations in the country to mark 70 years since the liberation of the last Nazi concentration camps at the end of World War Two .  \n\n[INST] What is the main point of the article?

Since then, efforts have been continuing to rescue it from closure and save the jobs of its 11,000 staff. Last week, a surprise late bid led by retail veteran Greg Tufnell transformed the race to acquire the retailer. His team, said to be backed by Portuguese money, is the front-runner. But if a deal cannot be struck, the business may still have to be liquidated. The remaining bidders have faded into the background. Another consortium led by Matalan tycoon John Hargreaves and Turkish retail entrepreneur Cafer Mahiroglu has reportedly run into difficulties, while other suitors have apparently failed to impress with their proposals. Some of those involved in the different bids have impressive retailing histories. But then Sir Philip Green, who controlled BHS from 2000 to 2015, also had a brilliant track record. And he ended up selling the business for Â£1. So what are the chances of saving BHS from the liquidators? And just who are the people aiming to do it? In the public eye, Greg Tufnell is easily overshadowed by his more famous brother Phil, the former England cricketer. But that could change if his bid for BHS is successful, because he hopes to become the firm's next chairman. And as far as his credentials for the job are concerned, the 54-year-old executive certainly talks the talk. He describes himself as \"a highly experienced managing director with Mothercare and Arcadia, a blend of entrepreneur, strategist and hands-on operator with significant commercial business turnaround, acquisition and fund-raising experience\". His record shows that he was buying and merchandising director at Next from 1991 to 1994. He then spent three years as managing director of menswear retailer Burton, part of the Arcadia group, followed by another three years as managing director of Mothercare. He currently appears to occupy a portfolio of different jobs, including the chairmanships of leather accessories brand Zatchels and recruitment consultancy hga Group. Earlier this month, he registered a new firm, Richess Group, at Companies House. Its other directors are Nick de Scossa, a Swiss banker, and Lisbon-based entrepreneur Jose Maria Soares Bento. Until Mr Tufnell's bid turned up, many observers had assumed that BHS would be snapped up by Matalan founder Mr Hargreaves. But it appears that the cost of a deal may have proved too high. Sources say Mr Hargreaves was asked to improve his offer and balked. Like Sir Philip Green, 71-year-old John Hargreaves also enjoys the life of the super-rich. He has an estimated fortune of Â£1bn, according to the Sunday Times Rich List. But in stark contrast to the ebullient Sir Philip, Mr Hargreaves is described by industry insiders as quiet-spoken, someone who shuns the limelight. Mr Hargreaves is no longer directly involved in the business he founded. He sold his 69% stake in Matalan in 2000, then in 2006 took it private through Missouri Bidco, a company 53.5% owned by him and his family. As a partner in Mr Hargreaves' bid, there is also Cafer Mahiroglu, the owner of Select Fashions.

The meeting followed claims the Tory MP called police \"plebs\", which he denied. Another officer, Sgt Chris Jones, has been cleared of misconduct. Det Sgt Hinton is from Warwickshire Police, Insp Mackaill works for West Mercia Police and Sgt Jones for West Midlands police. All three officers, who are Police Federation representatives in the Midlands, met the Conservative MP at his Sutton Coldfield constituency office in October 2012 to find out what he had said during a row in Downing Street. It followed reports he had sworn at officers and called them \"plebs\" for refusing to let him cycle though the street's main gate. After the meeting the men said Mr Mitchell had not given a full account and called for him to resign. But a recording of the meeting cast doubt on what they had said. The three officers then faced further criticism over evidence they gave to MPs before the home affairs select committee in October 2013. Carl Gumsley, commissioner for the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), directed Warwickshire Police on Monday to hold a misconduct hearing for Det Sgt Hinton. This was after the force declined to follow Mr Gumsley's earlier recommendation that there was a case to answer. West Mercia Police had decided, in line with Mr Gumsley's opinion, that Insp Mackaill has a case to answer for gross misconduct, and he should therefore face a misconduct hearing. In 2014, a High Court judge rejected a libel case brought by Mr Mitchell against the Sun newspaper, concluding that \"on the balance of probabilities\" he had called a police officer a \"pleb\". Mr Mitchell has accepted he used bad language but said he had not used that particular word. He paid Â£300,000 in legal costs after losing the case. Last year, the High Court described a misconduct investigation into the actions of the trio as \"lamentable\" saying there was a \"series of errors and irregularities\". The case was then referred back to the IPCC.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nThree police officers are accused of gross misconduct over their accounts of a meeting with David Mitchell, the Conservative MP .  \n\nArticle: \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  ", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "Three", "▁police", "▁officers", "▁are", "▁accused", "▁of", "▁gross", "▁mis", "con", "duct", "▁over", "▁their", "▁accounts", "▁of", "▁a", "▁meeting", "▁with", "▁David", "▁Mitchell", ",", "▁the", "▁Conserv", "ative", "▁MP", "▁.", "▁▁", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁", "<0x0A>", "▁▁", "<0x0A>", "▁▁", "<0x0A>", "▁▁", "<0x0A>", "▁▁", "<0x0A>", "▁▁", "<0x0A>", "▁▁", "<0x0A>", "▁▁", "<0x0A>", "▁▁", "<0x0A>", "▁▁", "<0x0A>", "▁▁", "<0x0A>", "▁▁", "<0x0A>", "▁▁", "<0x0A>", "▁▁", "<0x0A>", "▁▁", "<0x0A>", "▁▁", "<0x0A>"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.6377373933792114, -0.04127023369073868, 0.0, -0.3060995936393738, -0.9243937134742737, 0.0, -0.07906500995159149, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.00836133398115635, -0.6116514205932617, -0.06081073731184006, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -5.090107151772827e-05, -2.3841855067985307e-07, -2.992108420585282e-05, -0.47011658549308777, 0.0, -0.45874714851379395, -0.08282199501991272, -0.2761342227458954, 0.0, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -0.12090293318033218, -0.036419808864593506, 0.0, 0.0, -0.5131369829177856, 0.0, -5.364403477869928e-06, -0.0002915434306487441, -0.7014737725257874, -0.035298921167850494, 0.0, -0.052995484322309494, 0.0, -4.2676016164477915e-05, 0.0, -1.6689286894688848e-06, 0.0, -2.3841855067985307e-07, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "Three": -0.6377373933792114, "▁police": -0.04127023369073868, "▁officers": 0.0, "▁are": -0.3060995936393738, "▁accused": -0.9243937134742737, "▁of": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "▁gross": -0.07906500995159149, "▁mis": 0.0, "con": 0.0, "duct": 0.0, "▁over": -0.00836133398115635, "▁their": -0.6116514205932617, "▁accounts": -0.06081073731184006, "▁a": -5.090107151772827e-05, "▁meeting": -2.3841855067985307e-07, "▁with": -2.992108420585282e-05, "▁David": -0.47011658549308777, "▁Mitchell": 0.0, ",": -0.45874714851379395, "▁the": -0.08282199501991272, "▁Conserv": -0.2761342227458954, "ative": 0.0, "▁MP": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "▁.": -0.12090293318033218, "▁▁": 0.0, "Art": -0.5131369829177856, "icle": 0.0, ":": -5.364403477869928e-06, "▁": -0.0002915434306487441}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

But it left open a number of questions - did he mean everyone, no matter how remote, what technology will be used, and who is going to pay for it? Here is what David Cameron said: \"Just as our forebears effectively brought gas, electricity and water to all, we're going to bring fast broadband to every home and business that wants it.\" As the government has already promised to bring fast broadband to 95% of homes via the BDUK programme, this is all about reaching the final 5%. The digital minister Ed Vaizey gave further detail, explaining that the plan was to bring in a universal service obligation of 10Mbps for \"the very hardest to reach homes and businesses.\" But does that mean every home - even those up Welsh mountains or on remote Scottish islands? Let's presume it does, though just as with the obligation on BT to provide a phone line, there may be some upper limit on the costs involved in hooking up a home. Broadband campaigners have not greeted the government's pledge with huge enthusiasm. In particular, they have derided that 10Mbps minimum as woefully inadequate. I contacted a number of them to ask what the minimum speed should be and got answers ranging from 15Mbps to 100Mbps. There was also general agreement that fibre to the home was the technology which should be employed, though a few pointed out that 4G was now providing better speeds in some areas than fixed line broadband. The problem is that, even at a minimum 10Mbps, a universal service may prove an expensive undertaking and the cost of putting a 100Mbps fibre connection in every corner of the UK could be prohibitive. When the debate about fast broadband got going, it was calculated that universal coverage might cost at least Â£15 billion. A government which is implementing severe cuts in public spending will not be keen to put more money into broadband - although of course it is worth remembering that most of the cash spent so far on the BDUK programme has come from the TV licence fee. And just about all of that spending has been channelled through BT, which was the only company to apply for the money in most regions. Now the former monopoly telephone supplier looks likely to be a the centre of the effort to hook up the last 5%. But even if the government wanted to spend taxpayer funds to make that happen, there will be resistance from BT's rivals. Virgin Media has already called for an end to subsidies for rural broadband, claiming the market can now do the job - although it isn't clear that it will be moving to offer cable to every remote home. Meanwhile, there are signs of a split opening up between town and country over the subsidy issue.

Some of the items found included an armour-piercing improvised rocket and two anti-personnel mines. The main line of police inquiry is the arms belonged to dissident republicans. Last week, Home Secretary Theresa May said MI5 believed an attack on targets in Great Britain by dissident republicans had become \"a strong possibility\". Analysis: Vincent Kearney, BBC News NI's home affairs correspondent The discovery of what appears to be a second dissident republican arms dump near Larne within three months has left police baffled. Based on location alone, the analysis would be that the items found most likely belonged to loyalist paramilitaries. But the nature of what was found suggests otherwise and the finger of suspicion firmly in the direction of dissident republicans. Det Supt Kevin Geddes said the threat level in Northern Ireland from dissident republican groups remains \"severe\" and an attack is \"highly likely\". Police officers found three barrels hidden in holes in the forest. As well as rockets and mines, there were also several pipe bombs, assault rifle ammunition and parts to construct a \"substantial number of explosive devices\". Det Supt Geddes said the seizure was significant \"both in terms of its size and its capability\". \"A number of these devices were ready to be deployed,\" he added. \"This seizure has undoubtedly saved lives.\" He said the type of weapons that had been found meant police would focus their investigation on dissident republicans. In March, an arms find was made at Carnfunnock Country Park near Larne, and police said the were investigating a connection between the two discoveries. \"There are links in terms of the general location and the manner and method of storage and packaging of these munitions,\" Det Supt Geddes said. He added that police are \"indebted\" to the two people who noticed the suspicious objects in the Capanagh Forest.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nPolice have uncovered a terrorist hide in Northern Ireland.  \n\n[INST] Write a title for this article: Police have uncovered a terrorist hide in Northern Ireland.

Her mother mother Alison Hind, 28, died in the crash. Ms Hind's uncle Martin Pugh, 47, and his partner's parents Margaret, 65, and John Kehoe, 72, were also killed. Holly was flown to the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff after the collision around 15 miles (24km) from Aberystwyth, near Eisteddfa Gurig, between the villages of Llangurig in Powys and Ponterwyd in Ceredigion. The family's Ford Focus was travelling east on the A44, the transit van was driving behind it and the tanker was going in the opposite direction.

But when film icon Sir Michael Gambon likes the sounds of \"Don't Take Me Home\" so much that he fancies dropping by this week's London premiere then you realise the sporting storyline is a little special. \"When you hear a movie legend like that, likes the story then you know you've got a storyline that has a wide appeal beyond Welsh football,\" said director Jonny Owen. Don't Take Me Home, named after Wales football fans' Euro 2016 terrace anthem, premieres fittingly on St David's Day. But like Wales' down-to-earth players, the official premiere is far from the glitz and glamour of Leicester Square but more an industrial park outside of Pontypridd. But in the week that Leicester City's fall from Premier League grace finally unravelled with the sacking of their manager, you might be forgiven for thinking this is just an overindulgence about just another sporting fairytale. Hardly. This starts with the most tragic of beginnings - the death of Wales football manager Gary Speed. A group of young players, most of whom were friends after growing up together in Welsh youth teams, had to deal with the grief of not just losing their boss but their role model. In that context, what they achieved less than five years later - qualifying for Wales' first major championship finals in almost 60 years - seems \"worthy of immortalising in film\". It was certainly beyond the wildest fantasies of any Welsh football fan - especially when they were below Haiti and Guatemala at 117 in the world rankings in 2011. Then in November of the same year, Speed was found hanged in his garage, aged just 42. It did not just resonate in Wales and football, Speed's death shocked the country. \"Wales were constantly suffering so-called heartache, failing to qualify for tournaments at the final hurdle, but Gary's tragic death put those disappointments into perspective,\" said Owen. \"Gary's death was obviously devastating for his family and friends, but the sadness and grief must have affected this group of young lads who were loving playing football for one of their Welsh footballing heroes. \"It seemed to have a profound affect on them. It seemed to galvanise an already pretty strong bond, a togetherness and also context - as if they could come through this, then playing football and dealing with that pressure would be easier. \"No-one could have predicted then that virtually the same team would create history at Euro 2016 - those boys have some character.\" The rise to the European Championships was Roy of the Rovers stuff. Built on a foundation of structured defending with the added sprinkle of stardust from the world's most expensive player, Wales defied the odds and not just qualified for their first finals since the 1958 World Cup - they reached the semi-finals. No other team in history has risen up Fifa's world rankings quicker than Wales.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nA new film about Wales' Euro 2016 team is set to premiere on St David's Day .  \n\n[INST] Write an article with the given title: \"The 2018 FIFA World Cup is the 21st FIFA World Cup, the world'", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "A", "▁new", "▁film", "▁about", "▁Wales", "'", "▁Euro", "▁", "2", "0", "1", "6", "▁team", "▁is", "▁set", "▁to", "▁premi", "ere", "▁on", "▁St", "▁David", "'", "s", "▁Day", "▁.", "▁▁", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "[", "INST", "]", "▁Write", "▁an", "▁article", "▁with", "▁the", "▁given", "▁title", ":", "▁\"", "The", "▁", "2", "0", "1", "8", "▁FIFA", "▁World", "▁Cup", "▁is", "▁the", "▁", "2", "1", "st", "▁FIFA", "▁World", "▁Cup", ",", "▁the", "▁world", "'", "s"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.0256348866969347, -0.5776130557060242, -0.053180765360593796, -0.5868794322013855, -0.07895419001579285, -0.00047910655848681927, -0.09658601135015488, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.013820077292621136, -0.022644512355327606, -0.5119963884353638, -0.0012718691723421216, -0.36339762806892395, 0.0, -0.5091527104377747, -2.109982233378105e-05, -1.9788545614574105e-05, 0.0, 0.0, -4.541770613286644e-05, -0.08414407074451447, -0.256415456533432, -1.1920928244535389e-07, 0.0, -0.002533323597162962, 0.0, 0.0, -0.43721699714660645, -0.015490101650357246, -4.124556289752945e-05, -0.015500195324420929, -0.023246144875884056, -0.8744366765022278, -2.3841855067985307e-07, 0.0, -0.011407507583498955, -0.33521324396133423, -0.3261112868785858, -0.7147002816200256, -0.000972155889030546, -0.0018397325184196234, -0.4609144926071167, -0.7157183885574341, 0.0, 0.0, -0.7618516087532043, -0.0006678258068859577, -1.1920928244535389e-07, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.0003670972364488989, 0.0, 0.0, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -0.011142529547214508, -0.360908180475235, -8.821448318485636e-06, 0.0], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "A": -0.0256348866969347, "▁new": -0.5776130557060242, "▁film": -0.053180765360593796, "▁about": -0.5868794322013855, "▁Wales": -0.07895419001579285, "'": -8.821448318485636e-06, "▁Euro": -0.09658601135015488, "▁": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "2": 0.0, "0": -0.000972155889030546, "1": 0.0, "6": 0.0, "▁team": -0.013820077292621136, "▁is": -0.7618516087532043, "▁set": -0.5119963884353638, "▁to": -0.0012718691723421216, "▁premi": -0.36339762806892395, "ere": 0.0, "▁on": -0.5091527104377747, "▁St": -2.109982233378105e-05, "▁David": -1.9788545614574105e-05, "s": 0.0, "▁Day": -4.541770613286644e-05, "▁.": -0.08414407074451447, "▁▁": -0.256415456533432, "[": -0.002533323597162962, "INST": 0.0, "]": 0.0, "▁Write": -0.43721699714660645, "▁an": -0.015490101650357246, "▁article": -4.124556289752945e-05, "▁with": -0.015500195324420929, "▁the": -0.011142529547214508, "▁given": -0.8744366765022278, "▁title": -2.3841855067985307e-07, ":": 0.0, "▁\"": -0.011407507583498955, "The": -0.33521324396133423, "8": -0.4609144926071167, "▁FIFA": -0.0003670972364488989, "▁World": 0.0, "▁Cup": 0.0, "st": 0.0, ",": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "▁world": -0.360908180475235}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

Rescuers found Sophia and Poppy 200m from a dam on the family's property. The Australian Broadcasting Corp. quoted Sophia's grandmother, Vera Cook, who credited the dog with saving the toddler's life. She said that Sophia was wearing just a nappy and T-shirt when she wandered off. \"The only thing I was thinking was well, hopefully the dog would have kept her warm,\" Ms Cook was quoted as saying. \"If [the dog] wasn't with her, I don't know whether they would have found her.\" The family issued a statement thanking emergency services and promising that Poppy would be \"well fed this evening\".\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\nA pet dog is being credited with keeping a little girl safe after the pair wandered away from their family home and could not be found for hours.\n\n###\nArticle: The carmaker said it would build two new models at its Sunderland plant following talks with the government. Ministers have declined to confirm reports that a written promise was made to protect the company from any consequences of Brexit. Labour said the government should set out exactly what was promised. Speaking on BBC Question Time, Mr Clark indicated there had been no offer of financial compensation or state aid. \"There's no cheque book. I don't have a cheque book,\" he said. \"The important thing is that they know this is a country in which they can have confidence they can invest. That was the assurance and the understanding they had and they have invested their money.\" He said the announcement was \"fantastic news\", particularly for the workforce as the deal secures 7,000 jobs. The Japanese company's commitment to Britain's biggest car plant had been in doubt following the referendum on EU membership. Mr Clark's department declined to comment on a report in the Times newspaper that he had written to Nissan's board promising to ensure that UK operations would \"remain competitive\" after Britain left the EU. According to the newspaper, \"Mr Clark's letter is regarded by Nissan as a promise that it will not have to bear the cost of punitive tariffs on car exports if Britain leaves the EU customs area without a free trade agreement in place\". The Nissan announcement has led to calls from other car manufacturers for similar pledges. Toyota said it trusted the government to provide \"fair treatment\". But a senior Nissan Europe executive, Colin Lawther, said the company had received \"no special deal\". \"It's just a commitment from the government to work with the whole of the automotive industry to make sure the whole automotive industry in the UK remains competitive,\" he told the BBC. \"We would expect nothing for us that the rest of the industry wouldn't be able to have access to. We see this as a whole industry thing, not a Nissan thing.\" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the government must disclose any deals struck with the firm, saying it could not hide it from the public. Nissan confirmed it would build both the new Qashqai and the X-Trail SUV in Sunderland. A company spokesman said making the X-Trail could lead to hundreds of new jobs being created in the coming years. It will be the first time the model has been made outside Japan. The plant produced 475,000 vehicles last year - 80% of which were exported. Production of the next Qashqai model is expected to begin in 2018 or 2019.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nNissan has announced plans to build two new models at its Sunderland plant.

The dog, a one-year-old Australian sheepdog named Poppy, went with her. Police confirmed that Poppy's barking alerted rescuers to the whereabouts of the pair after a seven-hour search. Rescuers found Sophia and Poppy 200m from a dam on the family's property. The Australian Broadcasting Corp. quoted Sophia's grandmother, Vera Cook, who credited the dog with saving the toddler's life. She said that Sophia was wearing just a nappy and T-shirt when she wandered off. \"The only thing I was thinking was well, hopefully the dog would have kept her warm,\" Ms Cook was quoted as saying. \"If [the dog] wasn't with her, I don't know whether they would have found her.\" The family issued a statement thanking emergency services and promising that Poppy would be \"well fed this evening\".\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\nA pet dog is being credited with keeping a little girl safe after the pair wandered away from their family home and could not be found for hours.\n\n###\nArticle: Suppliers in England and Wales faced 106,693 complaints in 2014-15, a drop 13.4% compared to the previous year, the Consumer Council for Water said. About 60% of gripes were about billing and charges, the figures showed. The watchdog applauded the companies for their efforts, but said there was still room for improvement. It called on suppliers to improve their service by providing \"clear, accurate and timely\" bills. It added that speed in fixing reported leaks was still a source of frustration for customers. \"We expect the water industry to continually try and improve its services to customers and many water companies deserve credit for rising to that challenge year after year,\" said Tony Smith, chief executive of the Consumer Council for Water. \"However, the gulf between the best and worst performers remains unacceptable.\" Southern was the worst performing company for complaints per 10,000 connections, as it has been since 2012-13, although its complaint levels did fall by nearly 13% compared with the previous year. \"We are disappointed not to have made more progress on reducing complaints,\" said director Simon Oates. \"We have spent Â£13m to upgrade its billing system, which will help customers to manage their accounts online. Once this system has bedded in, we expect that we will see complaint numbers start to fall.\" Four companies - Anglian Water, Affinity Water, Portsmouth Water and Hartlepool Water - recorded increases in complaints compared with the previous year.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nA report shows that complaints about water companies in England and Wales fell last year.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "A", "▁report", "▁shows", "▁that", "▁compla", "ints", "▁about", "▁water", "▁companies", "▁in", "▁England", "▁and", "▁Wales", "▁fell", "▁last", "▁year", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁The", "▁number", "▁of", "▁people", "▁in", "▁the", "▁UK", "▁who", "▁are", "▁class", "ified", "▁as", "▁ob", "ese", "▁has", "▁ris", "en", "▁by", "▁", "1", "6", "%", "▁in", "▁the", "▁past", "▁de", "cade", ",", "▁according", "▁to", "▁a", "▁report", "▁by", "▁the", "▁UK", "'", "s", "▁Health"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.5389038324356079, -0.1966906636953354, -0.8340888023376465, -0.0023469780571758747, -0.2782868444919586, 0.0, -0.10127817839384079, -0.0008987916517071426, -0.030666343867778778, -0.10789664834737778, -0.00010442188795423135, 0.0, 0.0, -0.10006281733512878, -0.19629037380218506, 0.0, -0.25563472509384155, -0.0001062098381225951, 0.0, -1.0728830375228426e-06, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.07987722754478455, -0.5032047033309937, 0.0, -0.007072532549500465, -0.28957074880599976, -0.03425729647278786, -0.00528545631095767, -0.2507718801498413, -0.25448933243751526, -0.7224539518356323, -0.5063611268997192, 0.0, -0.1590029001235962, 0.0, -0.005098555237054825, -0.16096380352973938, 0.0, -0.03523608669638634, -0.011775743216276169, -0.07592154294252396, -0.6626436710357666, -0.061842452734708786, -0.17674656212329865, -0.002064598724246025, -0.1730116605758667, -0.5974851846694946, 0.0, -0.0002115741081070155, -0.022491484880447388, 0.0, -0.18944968283176422, -0.3858127295970917, -0.27800849080085754, -0.002217336092144251, -0.532561719417572, -0.6078259944915771, 0.0, -0.05814502760767937], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "A": -0.5389038324356079, "▁report": -0.3858127295970917, "▁shows": -0.8340888023376465, "▁that": -0.0023469780571758747, "▁compla": -0.2782868444919586, "ints": 0.0, "▁about": -0.10127817839384079, "▁water": -0.0008987916517071426, "▁companies": -0.030666343867778778, "▁in": -0.17674656212329865, "▁England": -0.00010442188795423135, "▁and": 0.0, "▁Wales": 0.0, "▁fell": -0.10006281733512878, "▁last": -0.19629037380218506, "▁year": 0.0, ".": -0.25563472509384155, "##": -1.0728830375228426e-06, "#": 0.0, "Art": 0.0, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "▁The": -0.07987722754478455, "▁number": -0.5032047033309937, "▁of": 0.0, "▁people": -0.007072532549500465, "▁the": -0.002217336092144251, "▁UK": -0.532561719417572, "▁who": -0.2507718801498413, "▁are": -0.25448933243751526, "▁class": -0.7224539518356323, "ified": -0.5063611268997192, "▁as": 0.0, "▁ob": -0.1590029001235962, "ese": 0.0, "▁has": -0.005098555237054825, "▁ris": -0.16096380352973938, "en": 0.0, "▁by": -0.27800849080085754, "▁": -0.011775743216276169, "1": -0.07592154294252396, "6": -0.6626436710357666, "%": -0.061842452734708786, "▁past": -0.1730116605758667, "▁de": -0.5974851846694946, "cade": 0.0, ",": -0.0002115741081070155, "▁according": -0.022491484880447388, "▁to": 0.0, "▁a": -0.18944968283176422, "'": -0.6078259944915771, "s": 0.0, "▁Health": -0.05814502760767937}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

Opinion is sharply divided, however, as to whether or not it is wise to invest in the country. Since 2004, its economy has been expanding by about 10% a year. The government expects growth to continue in double digits - but a report by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) suggests it will slow to 6.5% in 2013. Even the IMF predictions are impressive, however, considering the current global financial climate and the fact that unlike many other countries on the continent, Ethiopia does not have much in the way of natural resources. Coffee is one of the biggest export earners in Ethiopia. In Addis Ababa, the country's capital, coffee exporter Michael Girma says it was a challenge to launch his business. \"To start up in the export sector, you need to perform with your own cash. Then after that, you can approach the banks,\" he says. Apart from exporting coffee, he now also owns a cafe, a bar, and a pizzeria, employing 140 people altogether. Although the business environment is getting very competitive, he is achieving a profit margin of 20-30% each year and feels confident about the future. \"A lot has changed in the last seven years,\" he says. \"You need to be aggressive, but not arrogant.\" Although foreign investors are encouraged, many sectors are reserved for domestic investors. \"The restricted sectors are those which supply to the local people. If foreign investors want to come in and invest in projects which are export oriented, anything is open,\" he says. \"It would be very hard to compete otherwise.\" Despite annual high inflation, some investors think the potential in Africa's second most populous nation has not been recognised. Earlier this year, Shultze Global Investments launched a $100m equity fund aiming to invest in Ethiopian businesses. In a nondescript building on a hillside overlooking Addis Ababa, Berhane Demissie decides where to put that money. \"Ethiopia offers significant opportunities for investors,\" she says, pointing out that agriculture is a strong growth sector. \"Anything grows in Ethiopia with the various climate and soil diversities that we have. That also follows through to the agricultural value-added chain with processing and exports,\" Ms Demissie says. With 85% of the population dependent on the agricultural sector, she says the government is trying to ensure those farmers have access to finance and fertilisers that will allow them to grow more. Ms Demissie says this will lift people out of poverty. \"If the programme was just about big farms I would have said no, but the smallholder farmers are being included in the overall growth of the economy,\" she says. She also says there is a lot more demand for consumer goods and services within the country, but too few manufacturing companies. In 2010, Transparency International, which rates countries according to perceived corruption, listed Ethiopia at 120th out of 183 countries and the\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nEthiopia has one of the world's fastest growing economies, but it is still one of the poorest countries in the world.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "E", "th", "iop", "ia", "▁has", "▁one", "▁of", "▁the", "▁world", "'", "s", "▁fast", "est", "▁growing", "▁econom", "ies", ",", "▁but", "▁it", "▁is", "▁still", "▁one", "▁of", "▁the", "▁poor", "est", "▁countries", "▁in", "▁the", "▁world", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁The", "▁", "1", "9", "th", "▁Century", "▁French", "▁writer", ",", "▁Vol", "taire", ",", "▁once", "▁said", "▁that", "▁\"", "the", "▁best", "▁is", "▁yet", "▁to", "▁come", "\".", "▁The"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.0050063966773450375, -1.1920928244535389e-07, 0.0, 0.0, -0.2717338800430298, -0.12454508990049362, 0.0, -0.00015841660206206143, -0.07889040559530258, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -2.992108420585282e-05, 0.0, 0.0, -0.08161111176013947, -0.00044371772673912346, -0.4258597791194916, -0.010530855506658554, -0.004433801863342524, -3.373566141817719e-05, 0.0, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -0.0005529781919904053, 0.0, -2.992108420585282e-05, -0.0007180972606875002, -1.0728830375228426e-06, 0.0, -0.008871898986399174, -0.00016497205069754273, 0.0, -8.583032467868179e-06, 0.0, 0.0, -5.960462772236497e-07, 0.0, 0.0, -0.07383667677640915, -1.1548048257827759, -0.25823041796684265, -0.03526923060417175, -0.7235434055328369, -0.455453485250473, -0.9868901968002319, -0.5006897449493408, -0.7487049698829651, -0.2082664519548416, 0.0, -0.007130413316190243, -0.006233416497707367, -0.08107097446918488, -0.1214502826333046, -0.02027057111263275, -1.0632106065750122, -0.14935122430324554, -8.344646857949556e-07, -0.2519729733467102, 0.0, -0.6931471824645996, -0.06758705526590347, -1.2369660139083862], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "E": -0.0050063966773450375, "th": -0.7235434055328369, "iop": 0.0, "ia": 0.0, "▁has": -0.2717338800430298, "▁one": -3.373566141817719e-05, "▁of": 0.0, "▁the": -1.0728830375228426e-06, "▁world": 0.0, "'": 0.0, "s": 0.0, "▁fast": 0.0, "est": 0.0, "▁growing": -2.992108420585282e-05, "▁econom": 0.0, "ies": 0.0, ",": -0.007130413316190243, "▁but": -0.00044371772673912346, "▁it": -0.4258597791194916, "▁is": -8.344646857949556e-07, "▁still": -0.004433801863342524, "▁poor": -0.0005529781919904053, "▁countries": -2.992108420585282e-05, "▁in": -0.0007180972606875002, ".": -0.008871898986399174, "##": -8.583032467868179e-06, "#": 0.0, "Art": -5.960462772236497e-07, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "▁The": -1.2369660139083862, "▁": -1.1548048257827759, "1": -0.25823041796684265, "9": -0.03526923060417175, "▁Century": -0.455453485250473, "▁French": -0.9868901968002319, "▁writer": -0.5006897449493408, "▁Vol": -0.2082664519548416, "taire": 0.0, "▁once": -0.006233416497707367, "▁said": -0.08107097446918488, "▁that": -0.1214502826333046, "▁\"": -0.02027057111263275, "the": -1.0632106065750122, "▁best": -0.14935122430324554, "▁yet": -0.2519729733467102, "▁to": 0.0, "▁come": -0.6931471824645996, "\".": -0.06758705526590347}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

Mr Farage said he was \"not particularly in favour of Mr Hamilton's return to the front line, aged nearly 70\". Mr Hamilton replied: \"If Attenborough can still survive in a jungle of wild animals and predators at 90, I'm sure I'll be fine in the assembly.\" Mr Farage, who is 15 years younger than Mr Hamilton, had described the treatment of Mr Gill as \"an act of deep ingratitude\" after UKIP won its first seats in the assembly. Speaking about Mr Hamilton on LBC radio on Friday, Mr Farage said: \"I think it is difficult to return to frontline politics after a 20-year gap when you are getting on a bit in years. \"But there you are, perhaps he'll surprise me.\" He added: \"One thing I will say, he is utterly committed to this EU cause, and he has been since the 1960,\" referring to Mr Hamilton's opposition to UK membership of the European Union. In response, Mr Hamilton said: \"The average UKIP member will be very disappointed at Nigel's ageist remark. \"UKIP has many thousands of active and vigorous senior members. \"It seems particularly odd to knock old age at the very moment we celebrate the 90th birthdays of two icons of Britishness - Her Majesty the Queen and Sir David Attenborough. \"If Attenborough can still survive in a jungle of wild animals and predators at 90, I'm sure I'll be fine in the assembly. \"Clement Atlee was 65 when, as Prime Minister, he introduced the NHS. \"Churchill was 72 when he led us to victory against the Nazis. \"Ronald Reagan was 77 when he brought about the collapse of the Soviet Union and ended the Cold War. \"Is Nigel suggesting he could have done a better job than any of them, because he is 15 years younger than me?\" Among those who supported Nathan Gill in the leadership vote last week was Mark Reckless, a former Conservative MP and now a AM for South Wales East. Asked what the relationship between Mr Hamilton and Mr Gill was like, Mr Reckless said: \"Not good.\" \"I hope over time wounds will heal and we'll want to do the best for the people who voted for us and Wales as a whole,\" he told BBC Wales on Thursday. Mr Reckless said he had supported Mr Gill in the leadership challenge, but added: \"I accept the result.\" Of Mr Hamilton's bid to go for leader, Mr Reckless said: \"It's not what I would have done, but we are where we are. \"I don't want to say anything critical about Neil on that.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nA former Tory MP is seeking to lead the UK Independence Party's seven-strong assembly group in Wales .

Two decades on, the group's influence continues to be identifiable in popular culture - and in some unexpected ways. From how TV and newspapers cover music, to the way stars brand themselves, the Spice Girls influenced many of the rules for 21st Century pop stars. Before 1996, manufactured groups were expected to obey management and music label orders. Even though the five were put together by Bob and Chris Herbert, the group soon decided to replace the father-and-son management team with Simon Fuller. And against record company advice, they also chose their first single. \"If they decided they wanted to do something, then that's what was going to happen,\" says Wannabe's co-writer Richard \"Biff\" Stannard. Visual artist Liz West, a Guinness Book of Records entrant for the world's largest collection of Spice memorabilia (nearly 5,000 items), agrees. \"When it was suggested to people what their first single should be, they had already chosen it,\" she says. Wannabe's release came the year after the battle for chart dominance between the all-male Britpop groups Blur and Oasis. Timing was ripe for an opinionated girl group, says Paul Gorman, the first writer to interview them for Music Week. \"Britpop was a bunch of blokes going through their dads' record collections,\" he says. Wannabe's nursery-rhyme-style hypnotic chant secured a broad coalition of fans including those hard-to-get pre-teens who the music industry had previously considered as a small market. And in the following years, in the run-up to the millennium, the influence of the Spice Girls on this audience, led to the emergence of other acts aimed at a younger market. As a result, acts such as S Club 7, B*Witched, Aqua, Hanson, Steps and Billie Piper started to top the charts. Kim Glover, the manager of girlband B*Witched, who had four number one singles in the slipstream of Spice success says: \"They were very different from what had gone before them. Wannabe jumped out the radio - from the very first bar, you were hooked.\" The single was a springboard for 80m global album sales, and the now ingrained slogan \"Girl Power\". Yet not everyone was convinced. Girl Power, according to Gorman, was \"in many respects an empty phrase\". \"But it did mark a change in the way strong young British women saw themselves in the '90s and reflected the rise of ladette culture.\" \"Half of it was a marketing man's slogan,\" says Liz West. \"But as an 11-year-old girl, it instilled confidence in me.\" Glover is more positive. \"I personally loved it. As a woman in the music business, it resonated with me.\" Many current female stars such as Adele, Emma Stone, Jennifer Lawrence and Emma Watson have revealed they were and still are fans. Radio 1 DJ Jo Whiley told last month's Radio Times that Adele had Spice Girls photos on her fridge. She sang Spice Up Your Life at her June Amsterdam gig. \"Adele and other female\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nThe Spice Girls' Wannabe was the UK number one single for seven weeks and in February 1997, topped the US Billboard Hot 100 for four weeks.

Mr McCormack said: \"I'm whole heartedly behind the listing idea but that doesn't mean everything inside is worthy of listing. \"You've got to do it with humanity, courtesy and flexibility and you have to say to people why you want their home to be listed and get their interest going. \"They will be the best preservers of what is inside, they after all live there and it's their homes, and they want them to be the best as possible.\" In 2012 Guernsey's Environment Department held a questionnaire asking how important it was to protect Guernsey's historic buildings.

China promptly flew in rescue teams, sniffer dogs, medical equipment, tents, blankets and generators. Leaders of both the countries - Narendra Modi and Xi Jinping - were also quick to convey their condolences. \"For many people of our country, Nepalis are our own people,\" said Mr Modi in his monthly radio show on Sunday. The competition for influence in Nepal between the Asian giants is not new, but it appears to have escalated in recent years. Nepal's ties with India run deep and are often, according to many, schizophrenic. Many in Nepal - including the Maoists - have criticised its \"semi-colonial\" relationship with India, spoken about Indian \"expansionism\" and pointed to how their impoverished country had become India's \"bonded market\". Indian traders have controlled much of the lucrative parts of Nepal's economy. Asymmetrical water sharing treaties, many argue, have allowed downstream irrigation benefits for India. Nepalese opposition parties, playing the nationalist card, have sometimes thrived on anti-India rhetoric; and Maoists have derided other mainstream parties as India's brokers. On the other hand, Delhi is geographically, linguistically and culturally much closer to Nepal than China. The anti-India rhetoric softens when political parties come to power. \"India has been a political player in Nepal as much as any Nepali political party,\" says Michael Hutt, professor of Nepali and Himalayan studies at the University of London. Nepalese citizens continue to serve in the Gurkha regiment in Indian army; and Nepalese soldiers are trained in India. India also remains a main supplier of weapons to the Himalayan state. The fact that the two countries share an open border means that India's core interest in Nepal is security, writes Prashant Jha, in Battles of the New Republic: A Contemporary History of Nepal, an incisive account of its chequered recent history. \"Delhi needs a friendly regime in Kathmandu to prevent China from gaining space at its expense.\" So it is no surprise that India has rushed relief to its quake-ravaged neighbour. \"Nepal is central to India. Nepal has a special place in Indian thinking. It cannot be compared to China. India's response to the earthquake would have been strong and one of a kind, anyway,\" says Harsh V Pant, professor of international relations at London's Kings College. Yet, things may not be as simple. China's influence in the region appears to be growing rapidly. Last year China overtook India as Nepal's biggest foreign investor, investing heavily, among other things, in roads, power plants, transport and infrastructure. Trade between the two countries is on an upswing. Beijing has not minced words in telling Kathmandu that it needs to tamp down on pro-Tibet activists on its soil. A 2013 Human Rights Watch report said Nepal \"forcibly\" returns to China many Tibetans arrested at the border in contravention of rules. One report said Taiwan had been asked not to participate in the quake relief effort, although it is not clear whether China had anything to do with it. \"Nepal has also\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nIndia and China have been competing for influence in Nepal, and the earthquake has brought them together.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "Ind", "ia", "▁and", "▁China", "▁have", "▁been", "▁compet", "ing", "▁for", "▁influence", "▁in", "▁Nep", "al", ",", "▁and", "▁the", "▁earth", "qu", "ake", "▁has", "▁brought", "▁them", "▁together", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁The", "▁", "2", "0", "1", "5", "▁Nep", "al", "▁earth", "qu", "akes", "▁were", "▁a", "▁series", "▁of", "▁earth", "qu", "akes", "▁that", "▁occurred", "▁in", "▁Nep", "al", "▁on", "▁", "2", "5", "▁April", "▁and", "▁", "1"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.147269144654274, -3.576278118089249e-07, -0.055664341896772385, -5.602820692729438e-06, -0.36281633377075195, -0.18024420738220215, -0.021879134699702263, 0.0, -0.00025340684805996716, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -3.0278701160568744e-05, -7.152555099310121e-07, 0.0, -0.31956586241722107, -0.7826024889945984, -0.5466800332069397, -0.02384951151907444, 0.0, -0.00036459474358707666, -0.02282443456351757, -0.183431014418602, -0.7062714695930481, -0.2520338296890259, -0.25489988923072815, -0.00024530262453481555, 0.0, -8.821448318485636e-06, 0.0, 0.0, -1.9073468138230965e-06, 0.0, 0.0, -0.09425616264343262, -0.46752527356147766, -0.7096191048622131, -0.0001679517881711945, -0.0012723454274237156, -0.0019813207909464836, -0.0001387499796692282, 0.0, -1.1920922133867862e-06, 0.0, -0.36088407039642334, -0.00394993694499135, -1.2993727978027891e-05, -0.05304872989654541, 0.0, -0.3052751421928406, 0.0, 0.0, -0.0015136463334783912, -0.16479787230491638, -0.3609504699707031, -0.004194153938442469, 0.0, -0.0010831448016688228, -1.8715683836489916e-05, -1.6689286894688848e-06, 0.0, -7.152555099310121e-07, -0.5064550638198853, 0.0, -0.17301778495311737], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "Ind": -0.147269144654274, "ia": -3.576278118089249e-07, "▁and": -0.5064550638198853, "▁China": -5.602820692729438e-06, "▁have": -0.36281633377075195, "▁been": -0.18024420738220215, "▁compet": -0.021879134699702263, "ing": 0.0, "▁for": -0.00025340684805996716, "▁influence": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "▁in": -0.3609504699707031, "▁Nep": -0.004194153938442469, "al": 0.0, ",": -0.31956586241722107, "▁the": -0.5466800332069397, "▁earth": -0.3052751421928406, "qu": 0.0, "ake": -0.00036459474358707666, "▁has": -0.02282443456351757, "▁brought": -0.183431014418602, "▁them": -0.7062714695930481, "▁together": -0.2520338296890259, ".": -0.25489988923072815, "##": -8.821448318485636e-06, "#": 0.0, "Art": -1.9073468138230965e-06, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "▁The": -0.09425616264343262, "▁": 0.0, "2": -1.6689286894688848e-06, "0": -0.0001679517881711945, "1": -0.17301778495311737, "5": 0.0, "akes": 0.0, "▁were": -0.00394993694499135, "▁a": -1.2993727978027891e-05, "▁series": -0.05304872989654541, "▁of": 0.0, "▁that": -0.0015136463334783912, "▁occurred": -0.16479787230491638, "▁on": -0.0010831448016688228, "▁April": -7.152555099310121e-07}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

In a statement on Friday, Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers said she is also to establish a fund to tackle organised crime associated with paramilitary groups. The two unionist parties now say they will join cross-party talks on Monday. Unionists had said the issue of continued paramilitary activity was crucial to their involvement. Democratic Unionist Party leader Peter Robinson said he was \"content\" with the announcement. \"Policing and security in Northern Ireland is not just the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Executive, the secretary of state has a particular responsibility as well,\" Mr Robinson said. The National Crime Agency (NCA) became operational in Northern Ireland in May. Given its wide-ranging remit and resources, it would be reasonable to assume it knows the extent of paramilitary involvement in organised crime in Northern Ireland. It should be in a position to provide an assessment of paramilitary involvement to the Northern Ireland Secretary and political parties. So, it seems unlikely that the review to be published by the independent panel in October will tell Theresa Villiers and political parties anything they could not be told today by the NCA and the Police Service of Northern Ireland.

The Ulster Unionist Party leader Mike Nesbitt described Ms Villiers statement as a \"positive step forward\". Ms Villiers said the assessment of paramilitaries would be carried out by UK security agencies and the Police Service of Northern Ireland, and would be reviewed and checked by three people whose names would be announced early next week. \"I also intend to establish dedicated funding aimed at increasing the capability of agencies working to tackle criminality and organised crime associated with paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland,\" she said. \"It will support agencies to enhance specialist capabilities such as forensic accounting to strengthen their capacity to seize criminal assets. \"Lastly, I am planning to discuss with the Northern Ireland justice minister and the Irish justice minister how we can work best together in our efforts to tackle cross-border crime.\" Read more on how the crisis unfolded In response, Sinn FÃ©in's Martin McGuinness said: \"Obviously with today's developments and the response of unionist leaders, as we hoped all-party talks will resume on Monday. \"We're entering the talks on Monday in a positive and constructive spirit.\" But on the subject of the assessment, the deputy first minister added: \"I don't think anybody is going to learn anything over the next four weeks that they didn't know over the last 20 years.\" The Police Service of Northern Ireland's Chief Constable George Hamilton said he welcomed the \"clear focus\" on organised crime that the assessment would provide. Irish Foreign Minister Charlie Flanagan said it would be a \"once-off exercise\". He added that it was intended to assist the political parties in considering \"how the impact and legacy of paramilitary activity should best be addressed\".

Andrew Watson, an executive director on the Yorkshire Cricket Board, was one of the key thinkers behind the decision. \"We had a national playing survey for three years,\" he said. \"Stronger players and the stronger clubs wanted more competitive cricket and the other players from other leagues wanted more regional cricket, so they didn't have to travel so far. We engaged every league in Yorkshire with that.\" Under the old system, there were two premier leagues - the North Yorkshire League and the South Durham League. The Yorkshire league has been split into two to form Yorkshire League North and Yorkshire League South, with the Bradford League added in. There are then partner leagues beneath these and promotion and relegation are both possible. The clubs are now coming to the end of their first year under this system. The top two teams from each of the premier leagues will feature in an end-of-season champion of champions play-off, with the final taking place in Abu Dhabi in October. One long-standing club affected by this change is Pudsey Congs - former player and club spokesperson Ralph Middlebrook believes the move will bridge the gap between league cricketers and professionals, as clubs that win promotion to one of the premier leagues must also meet ECB ground standards. \"The standard of cricket is going to improve and the standard of pitches is going to improve,\" said Middlebrook. \"There are certain factors that are mandatory on clubs. You must have under-11s, under-13s, under-15s. You must have covers. You must have Clubmark, which is the ECB standard for everything, from child welfare through to development plans. \"It's going to give people who are keen to be professionals the chance to go to a club that's on the verge of the first-class game. \"And it's not just about excellence. It's about the other clubs lower down being able to find their own level.\" He continued: \"If you just want to be a local club, with people in the locality playing and supporting cricket in their area, you can do that. Not all clubs want to be Premier League clubs with the professional standards they would have to provide. \"If you're thinking of being a pro, you'd better go to a decent club with a decent pitch and see if you can hack it.\" Ringing these changes could be difficult for sides with limited resources, but the Yorkshire Cricket Board have a support network in place for clubs facing the transition.

The Rivers Agency said prolonged rainfall meant saturated ground and high water levels in lakes and rivers. Its chief executive, David Porter, said they were monitoring the situation. \"Rivers Agency and the Electricity Supply Board (ESB) in the south are responsible for controlling the lough levels and we are working closely to ensure everything can be done to reduce the levels and therefore the impact of any flooding,\" he said. \"A combination of generation and spilling at the hydroelectric power stations at Cliff and Ballyshannon in Donegal is ongoing to ensure that water can leave the Erne system as quickly as it can flow down to the dams. \"It should, however, be recognised that heavy rain can result in a greater inflow than can possibly be dealt with, even when spilling is in progress.\" He said the River Blackwater, which flows through counties Armagh and Tyrone, was at its \"highest recorded level in 45 years but has now peaked\". In County Armagh, firefighters rescued a man from a van that was trapped in flood water. It happened in the Armagh Road area of Charlemont at about 08:00 GMT on Wednesday. The man was not injured. Some businesses have also been affected by the flooding. Tom Leonard, who is the owner of a marina at Carrybridge, County Fermanagh, said water levels were within \"seven to eight inches\" of what they were in 2009. \"It has left us now today that we are trying to salvage the customers' boats and protect them,\" he said. \"At the moment, after this week then we have to lay off all the lads until after Christmas which annoys me more than anything else. \"They have been with us all summer and now we have to lay them off in the mouth of Christmas because we just don't have a workshop to work in and we have lost all our stock.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nFlooding continues to affect parts of Northern Ireland in the wake of Storm Desmond at the weekend .\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "F", "lo", "oding", "▁continues", "▁to", "▁affect", "▁parts", "▁of", "▁Northern", "▁Ireland", "▁in", "▁the", "▁w", "ake", "▁of", "▁Storm", "▁Des", "mond", "▁at", "▁the", "▁week", "end", "▁.", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁The", "▁head", "▁of", "▁the", "▁United", "▁Nations", "▁has", "▁condem", "ned", "▁the", "▁\"", "atro", "cious", "\"", "▁murder", "▁of", "▁a", "▁top", "▁Russian", "▁opposition", "▁leader", "▁and", "▁called", "▁for", "▁a", "▁thorough", "▁investigation", ".", "▁Alexander", "▁Lit", "vin", "en"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.23520290851593018, 0.0, -0.00013433984713628888, -0.2832469046115875, -0.000364713923772797, -8.344646857949556e-07, -0.000840906286612153, 0.0, -3.576278118089249e-07, 0.0, -0.018908606842160225, 0.0, -1.6689286894688848e-06, 0.0, 0.0, -1.1920928244535389e-07, 0.0, 0.0, -0.003141232766211033, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.512520432472229, -0.21930232644081116, 0.0, -0.08304494619369507, 0.0, 0.0, -1.1920928244535389e-07, 0.0, 0.0, -0.1768088936805725, -0.9550968408584595, -2.3841855067985307e-07, -0.0012979424791410565, -0.5150597095489502, -0.00015424491721205413, -0.5527176856994629, -0.5082399845123291, 0.0, -0.00021288513380568475, -0.26796454191207886, -1.4204734563827515, -6.198863957251888e-06, -0.0006984416977502406, -0.06008211523294449, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -0.16407638788223267, -0.9366075992584229, -0.025360403582453728, -0.06250753253698349, -0.11144052445888519, -0.5073539614677429, -0.15066814422607422, -0.25192922353744507, -0.26340392231941223, -0.0016902696806937456, -0.0011189873330295086, -0.45352667570114136, -0.19121547043323517, -0.007937673479318619, 0.0, 0.0], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "F": -0.23520290851593018, "lo": 0.0, "oding": -0.00013433984713628888, "▁continues": -0.2832469046115875, "▁to": -0.000364713923772797, "▁affect": -8.344646857949556e-07, "▁parts": -0.000840906286612153, "▁of": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "▁Northern": -3.576278118089249e-07, "▁Ireland": 0.0, "▁in": -0.018908606842160225, "▁the": -0.00021288513380568475, "▁w": -1.6689286894688848e-06, "ake": 0.0, "▁Storm": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "▁Des": 0.0, "mond": 0.0, "▁at": -0.003141232766211033, "▁week": 0.0, "end": 0.0, "▁.": -0.512520432472229, "##": -0.08304494619369507, "#": 0.0, "Art": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "▁The": -0.1768088936805725, "▁head": -0.9550968408584595, "▁United": -0.5150597095489502, "▁Nations": -0.00015424491721205413, "▁has": -0.5527176856994629, "▁condem": -0.5082399845123291, "ned": 0.0, "▁\"": -0.26796454191207886, "atro": -1.4204734563827515, "cious": -6.198863957251888e-06, "\"": -0.0006984416977502406, "▁murder": -0.06008211523294449, "▁a": -0.26340392231941223, "▁top": -0.9366075992584229, "▁Russian": -0.025360403582453728, "▁opposition": -0.06250753253698349, "▁leader": -0.11144052445888519, "▁and": -0.5073539614677429, "▁called": -0.15066814422607422, "▁for": -0.25192922353744507, "▁thorough": -0.0016902696806937456, "▁investigation": -0.0011189873330295086, ".": -0.45352667570114136, "▁Alexander": -0.19121547043323517, "▁Lit": -0.007937673479318619, "vin": 0.0, "en": 0.0}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

People from different backgrounds all met through blogging and hoped to use technology for social change. It meant we have all gained good contacts, experience and strong networks. I like to think the social network is the people itself. Things like Facebook, Twitter, SMS and phones are just social tools. When they blocked Facebook and shut down technology, our network still operated because it's about people. Internet activists are also people and a lot of our organising, social work and relationships are developed offline. This is something that people dreamt of but didn't anticipate happening in reality. If anything, it shows that all the effort we put in over the past few years has not been wasted. It has climaxed into this critical mass of people you see in the square. At the moment I'm not getting a lot of internet connection. I'm trying not to drain my phone battery. We're still using it to distribute footage people are bringing to us that we've sorted through. I hope the internet will continue to play a complementary role in activism. At the moment we physically exist in downtown Cairo and I hope that when we have finished this sit-in, we will have won the right to organise ourselves outside the internet. Twitter: Amr Gharbeia I was involved in this revolution from the first day, 25 January, and I've now been spending my nights here for a while. For the past five years, I was very active online, blogging and tweeting. As we live under emergency laws in Egypt it has been very difficult to meet or communicate except on the internet. I'd never been part of a demonstration on the ground. At first we were mocking the event on 25 January. We questioned whether it was really possible to have a \"Facebook revolution\". I came on the 25th because I felt it was my duty as a citizen and I couldn't believe how it turned into something so different from what we've seen before. I was walking among the people and weeping. Now I sometimes just tweet to update people about what's going on or to call for a million-man demonstration or a day to remember our martyrs. I'm well-known among bloggers for my long articles and constant tweets, but once I was here I stopped communicating this way so much. I felt it was totally different to have real freedom rather than just hypothetical freedom or internet freedom. Blogging and tweeting has been important as we were building our minds.

Rescuers found Sophia and Poppy 200m from a dam on the family's property. The Australian Broadcasting Corp. quoted Sophia's grandmother, Vera Cook, who credited the dog with saving the toddler's life. She said that Sophia was wearing just a nappy and T-shirt when she wandered off. \"The only thing I was thinking was well, hopefully the dog would have kept her warm,\" Ms Cook was quoted as saying. \"If [the dog] wasn't with her, I don't know whether they would have found her.\" The family issued a statement thanking emergency services and promising that Poppy would be \"well fed this evening\".\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\nA pet dog is being credited with keeping a little girl safe after the pair wandered away from their family home and could not be found for hours.\n\n###\nArticle: A report by the organisation suggests men, women and children are being abused \"to eliminate public protest\". Many are subjected to virginity tests, rape and gang rape after arrest. Egypt's Interior Ministry said it would not comment until it had studied the report. The study notes a surge in sexual violence after the Egyptian military takeover in July 2013. The perpetrators are rarely held to account and the impunity points to a \"cynical political strategy aimed at silencing all opposition\". Police, intelligence officers and members of the military are guilty of targeting male and female detainees, according to the report. Among the victims are student demonstrators, human rights activists, gay people and children. Student's ordeal I saw an officer who was grabbing a young woman by the breasts and I said to him: \"If you want to arrest her, then arrest her, but you have no right to touch her breasts.\" He grabbed me exactly as he had her, before calling two other police officers to come and hold me. They beat me, insulted me. In the van they insulted me and beat me so much that I could no longer stand up. Two soldiers started to sexually assault me. The officer from the start got into the van and said to me: \"Come here I'm going to show you if I'm a man.\" He sexually assaulted me, the soldiers laughed, and then he raped me completely. I was paralysed, I started to vomit blood. My life is ruined. I'm afraid of my son, my husband and even my father. The authors said they did not have evidence that commanders were giving the orders, but the scale of the violence - and the impunity - suggested there was a political strategy. They claim that victims who file complaints are systematically obstructed by the justice system, and face threats and reprisals by police officers and prison guards. Sexual violence has long been a problem within the general population in Egypt, with assaults dramatically increasing in the years since Hosni Mubarak was removed from power. Last year, President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi ordered police to launch a crackdown amid growing public anger. He said sexual assaults, were \"an unacceptable form of conduct\" and called for citizens to \"reinstate moral values in society\".\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nA report says sexual violence is being used to silence protesters in Egypt.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "A", "▁report", "▁says", "▁sexual", "▁violence", "▁is", "▁being", "▁used", "▁to", "▁silence", "▁protest", "ers", "▁in", "▁Egypt", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁The", "▁EU", "▁has", "▁launched", "▁a", "▁new", "▁initi", "ative", "▁to", "▁help", "▁the", "▁millions", "▁of", "▁people", "▁in", "▁the", "▁world", "▁who", "▁are", "▁not", "▁using", "▁the", "▁internet", ".", "▁The", "▁EU", "'", "s", "▁Digital", "▁Single", "▁Market", "▁Commission", "er", ",", "▁El", "ż", "bi", "eta", "▁B", "ie"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.02652173675596714, -0.04021477699279785, -0.2187168300151825, -0.4009317457675934, -0.005698625463992357, -0.08287400752305984, -0.005084204487502575, -4.291525328881107e-06, -0.40042218565940857, -0.015818702057003975, -0.5908804535865784, -0.3773287534713745, -0.0002431573811918497, -2.3841855067985307e-07, -0.18649622797966003, -0.039889972656965256, 0.0, -1.2993727978027891e-05, 0.0, 0.0, -1.1920928244535389e-07, 0.0, 0.0, -0.17760659754276276, -0.9868885278701782, -0.43505606055259705, -0.8323372602462769, -0.05918128788471222, -0.2599763572216034, -0.2821975350379944, 0.0, -0.0030559052247554064, -0.26326796412467957, -0.20845703780651093, -0.3972955644130707, -5.960462772236497e-07, -0.1536487191915512, -0.23326538503170013, -0.004035188350826502, -0.031335726380348206, -0.002512990264222026, -0.18495583534240723, -0.956612229347229, -0.7374953627586365, -3.933898824470816e-06, -0.0019286142196506262, -0.05176139250397682, -0.0030163289047777653, -0.08128035813570023, -0.20705372095108032, 0.0, -1.0523737668991089, -0.5063920021057129, 0.0, -0.1578536033630371, 0.0, -0.021114686504006386, -0.01826491206884384, -0.0017080017132684588, 0.0, 0.0, -3.576278118089249e-07, 0.0], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "A": -0.02652173675596714, "▁report": -0.04021477699279785, "▁says": -0.2187168300151825, "▁sexual": -0.4009317457675934, "▁violence": -0.005698625463992357, "▁is": -0.08287400752305984, "▁being": -0.005084204487502575, "▁used": -4.291525328881107e-06, "▁to": -0.0030559052247554064, "▁silence": -0.015818702057003975, "▁protest": -0.5908804535865784, "ers": -0.3773287534713745, "▁in": -0.23326538503170013, "▁Egypt": -2.3841855067985307e-07, ".": -0.05176139250397682, "##": -1.2993727978027891e-05, "#": 0.0, "Art": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "▁The": -0.0030163289047777653, "▁EU": -0.08128035813570023, "▁has": -0.43505606055259705, "▁launched": -0.8323372602462769, "▁a": -0.05918128788471222, "▁new": -0.2599763572216034, "▁initi": -0.2821975350379944, "ative": 0.0, "▁help": -0.26326796412467957, "▁the": -3.933898824470816e-06, "▁millions": -0.3972955644130707, "▁of": -5.960462772236497e-07, "▁people": -0.1536487191915512, "▁world": -0.031335726380348206, "▁who": -0.002512990264222026, "▁are": -0.18495583534240723, "▁not": -0.956612229347229, "▁using": -0.7374953627586365, "▁internet": -0.0019286142196506262, "'": -0.20705372095108032, "s": 0.0, "▁Digital": -1.0523737668991089, "▁Single": -0.5063920021057129, "▁Market": 0.0, "▁Commission": -0.1578536033630371, "er": 0.0, ",": -0.021114686504006386, "▁El": -0.01826491206884384, "ż": -0.0017080017132684588, "bi": 0.0, "eta": 0.0, "▁B": -3.576278118089249e-07, "ie": 0.0}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

The two companies currently have a combined worldwide workforce of approximately 9,000 people. The information is contained in a detailed prospectus published by Standard Life on the deal. Managers said they expected \"natural turnover\" to account for some of the reductions, while other steps will be taken to minimise compulsory redundancies. The merger of Edinburgh-based Standard Life and Aberdeen is aimed at creating cost savings that could add up to £200m per year. The prospectus for shareholders stated \"there will be a need to maximise operational efficiencies and cost synergies\" to achieve the expected benefits of the merger. It continued: \"At this time it is estimated that the integration and restructuring will result in a phased reduction of approximately 800 roles from the total global headcount of the combined group as at 31 December 2016 of approximately 9,000 over the three-year integration period. \"Synergies will come in part from employee departures arising from natural turnover. \"Other appropriate steps will be taken to minimise the number of compulsory redundancies, including the active management of Standard Life's and Aberdeen's recruitment and vacancies.\" The document reveals that the newly-merged company will be renamed Standard Life Aberdeen plc. Both companies have agreed on a 16-strong board made up of an equal number of Standard Life and Aberdeen directors. Standard Life chairman Sir Gerry Grimstone will be the chairman of the newly-merged company while Aberdeen's chairman Simon Troughton will become deputy chairman. Keith Skeoch, the Standard Life chief executive, and Aberdeen boss Martin Gilbert will become co-chief executives of the new firm. The two companies agreed the terms of the merger, which will create Britain's biggest asset manager, in March. Under the terms of the deal, Aberdeen shareholders would own 33.3% and Standard Life shareholders would own 66.7% of the combined group. A general meeting has been scheduled for June at which shareholders will be asked to approve the merger.

Celebrating Mass, the Pope said Christmas was the time to \"once more discover who we are\". He called on believers to show the same simplicity as the child Jesus, \"born into poverty in a manger despite his divinity\" to inspire their lives. \"In a society so often intoxicated by consumerism and hedonism, wealth and extravagance, appearances and narcissism, this child calls us to act soberly, in other words, in a way that is simple, balanced, consistent, capable of seeing and doing what is essential,\" he said.

Everyone who went into the basilica, the largest church in Christendom, had to pass through metal detectors. Correspondents say the Pope, 79, used his homily to reflect the key themes of three years in office - mercy, compassion, empathy and justice. \"In a world which all too often is merciless to the sinner and lenient to the sin, we need to cultivate a strong sense of justice, to discern and to do God's will,\" he said.

The firm admitted a Health and Safety Executive (HSE) breach and was fined Â£7,500. It must also pay Â£1,120 costs. The hearing heard how the worker had to have the big toe on his left foot amputated and two other toes removed. He was in hospital for seven days but has since returned to work, the hearing heard.

Among them is a likely agreement with French aircraft manufacturer Airbus for more than 100 new aircraft. Mr Rouhani will also meet French President Francois Hollande. Mr Rouhani's five-day visit to Italy and France is the first by an Iranian president in nearly two decades, as the Iranian president seeks to rebuild economic ties and secure new trade deals. Iran is likely to need hundreds of new aircraft in the coming years as it re-establishes commercial air travel restricted by the sanctions, and French carmakers will once again be free to supply to the Islamic Republic. As well as a deal for Airbus planes, contracts are likely to be signed with car manufacturers Peugeot and Renault, Mr Rouhani told reporters on Monday. In Italy, Mr Rouhani met with President Matteo Renzi and Pope Francis. Monday saw contracts worth around €17bn ($18.4bn; £12bn) signed between Iranian and Italian companies. At Rome's Capitoline Museum, where Mr Rouhani and Mr Renzi met, nude statues were covered up and wine was removed from official menus out of respect for the Islamic Republic's strict laws governing propriety. Iranian diplomats reportedly requested that no wine be served at Mr Rouhani's lunch meeting with Mr Hollande, leading French officials to postpone the meeting until after lunch. During their meeting, Pope Francis urged Iran to work with other Middle Eastern countries against terrorism and arms trafficking, the Vatican said. Iran has been accused of funding militant groups, such as Hezbollah in Lebanon. Mr Rouhani asked the pontiff to pray for him, and gave him the gift of a hand-made carpet.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nIranian President Hassan Rouhani is expected to secure valuable trade deals following the lifting of international sanctions over Iran's nuclear programme.  \n\nArticle: 2 / 2  \n\nArticle: 1 / 2  \n\nArticle: 1 ", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "I", "ran", "ian", "▁President", "▁Hass", "an", "▁Rou", "h", "ani", "▁is", "▁expected", "▁to", "▁secure", "▁valuable", "▁trade", "▁de", "als", "▁following", "▁the", "▁lif", "ting", "▁of", "▁international", "▁san", "ctions", "▁over", "▁Iran", "'", "s", "▁nuclear", "▁programme", ".", "▁▁", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁", "2", "▁/", "▁", "2", "▁▁", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁", "1", "▁/", "▁", "2", "▁▁", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "▁", "1", "▁/"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.0204056017100811, 0.0, -0.5067421793937683, -0.0003649522550404072, -0.0029246911872178316, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.0038948405999690294, -1.0264699459075928, 0.0, -0.11766011267900467, -0.0008453133050352335, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.10198117792606354, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -6.890059739816934e-05, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.00029523781267926097, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.0012718691723421216, -0.27930164337158203, -0.27082857489585876, 0.0, 0.0, -0.05427762120962143, 0.0, -6.198863957251888e-06, -0.0004032037395518273, -0.48685556650161743, -0.01579499989748001, 0.0, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -0.6542511582374573, 0.0, -8.821098163025454e-05, -0.26944389939308167, 0.0, -0.00010477947944309562, -3.504691630951129e-05, -0.2677804231643677, -2.2053474822314456e-05, 0.0, -0.0005529781919904053, -3.135155202471651e-05, 0.0, 0.0, -4.339123915997334e-05, 0.0, 0.0, -6.556489552167477e-06, -0.09927546977996826, -3.576278118089249e-07], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": 0.0, "I": -0.0204056017100811, "ran": 0.0, "ian": -0.5067421793937683, "▁President": -0.0003649522550404072, "▁Hass": -0.0029246911872178316, "an": 0.0, "▁Rou": 0.0, "h": 0.0, "ani": 0.0, "▁is": -0.0038948405999690294, "▁expected": -1.0264699459075928, "▁to": 0.0, "▁secure": -0.11766011267900467, "▁valuable": -0.0008453133050352335, "▁trade": 0.0, "▁de": 0.0, "als": 0.0, "▁following": -0.10198117792606354, "▁the": 0.0, "▁lif": 0.0, "ting": 0.0, "▁of": 0.0, "▁international": -6.890059739816934e-05, "▁san": 0.0, "ctions": 0.0, "▁over": 0.0, "▁Iran": -0.00029523781267926097, "'": 0.0, "s": 0.0, "▁nuclear": 0.0, "▁programme": -0.0012718691723421216, ".": -0.27930164337158203, "▁▁": -3.135155202471651e-05, "Art": -4.339123915997334e-05, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "▁": -6.556489552167477e-06, "2": -0.0005529781919904053, "▁/": -3.576278118089249e-07, "1": -0.09927546977996826}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}
